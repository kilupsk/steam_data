364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,Overall the gameplay is great and if you are interested in this title because of the Total war series or Warhammer series this game is great for that. Also if you are new to RTS this is a great game to sink your teeth in.....   BUT THERE IS A HUGE FLAW OF THIS GAME AND THAT IS THE MARKETING CRAP!!!!! they will try to selling every little thing they can like sell races as dlc that are already in the game or sell a little option box (Blood and gore dlc) The game may be great but this money grabbing and using of their customers is just sicking and i hate that they are doing this to this game... SEGA stop the money grabbing bull crap...  So just for the horrible money grabbing crap i have to give this a negative review cause maybe they will listen and quit this crap before their customers take action and quit buying all of it.,-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Really had fun of the game, played using the Radious of course, as the game without this mod is very messy but still fun.  BUT! there we are again; same old CA sh**t with DLCs tempting you with something 'awesome', adding a mechanic that should have already existed (yes, that's AMBUSHING, a pretty much COMMON strategic play) but no, you have to pay 15 euros to have that And even if i buy that, what will it give me? 30 hours at max, then i will realise that i bought just one more faction. :( Well now, when I was on rome 2 and Attila, i ignored such stupidity and i bought the DLCs. this time i will pass (finally realising that i was stupid all that time)  So unlike prevous titles this is a trilogy, because this time they're like 'If we can have 100 bucks for 1 game, why not make three of them!!!!!!!!!'  So, I'm sorry i liked the game, pretty awesome but i think that finally, after so many years of playing, that Total War is finally dead to me. Still though, if you want to, there are many other warhammer-themed games out there so try these.  PS. Oh I bet this review will be deleted very soon, hahahahaha , in this case you're pathetic guys   Sincerely,  A dissapointed fan :(",-1,1,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"This is probably the worst game on steam. It's just cookie clicker or adventure capitalist but worse. Just imagine a game where you have to wait hours to do anything and has no actual action at all. Does that game seem good? And to add to that trainwreck of a game I just described, there are microtransactions! Who needs to wait for some monster to die when you can just use real money to speed things up? So when you play the game (should I even refer to it as a game?) you have two options: Wait incredibly long amounts of time for no reason, or pay real money to not wait incredibly long amounts of time. Or you can do the third option: Don't play it.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I definately recommend the game its alot of fun. However best players in game tend to go to the defending side everytime because you can more easily kill people that are pushing a wagon etc. In the end objectives get completed last minute because everyone is acting like its a tdm until they realize times almost up. Stay with your team most of all is my advice don't wander off like your Chuck Norris.  Just one complaint is the stamina bar. The stamina bar for knights or vanguards carrying these very heavy weapons seems like it was intended. For example knights with a sledge (that looks like it weighs 50lb!) can whip that thing around for a lonnnnnngggg time. For Christs sake they can even drag with it (dragging means to make weapon swing faster or slower). It seems like these big weapons should swing a little slower or drain more stamina. Bascially a player thats good with a sledge is like superman on the battlefield swinging a 3 times bigger hammer than thor probly with the same weight around lol. The swordsmen instead have the same stamina and weigh 3 times less. Swordsmen are supposed to be at least 2 or 3 times quicker but not in this game. All that armor and being able to function like a swordsman is like twilight zone weird to me.  For the non believers Go to your local knight apparell store and purchase some knight armor that could weigh anywhere from 60-100lbs. Ok now try to run wearing that and see if you can beat your friend who has no armor in a race!  Second test Go back to the store and grab the biggest sledge you can find, maybe the biggest 20lbs at menards or some ♥♥♥♥. Keep in mind the games hammer weighs a ♥♥♥♥ ton more! Now give your friend a standard medevial sword doesn't have to be special, new, clean, or whatever. Go outside and start swinging to the death! Notice that your friend sees you pick up sledge an swing from 10 miles away because? you guessed it, its heavy as ♥♥♥♥! One swing your friend backs up and swings left to right and your liver and other important organs seep down your legs. This is what any normal person with a hammer would do. Drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon and run for the mother ♥♥♥♥ing hills!!!!!!   ",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've been playing total war since Rome: Total War. I've really enjoyed the different time periods and locations throughout the years that I've had the experience of playing. The addition of Total War is absolutely brilliant. I could not be more in love with this game. The fantasy element added to this game really compliments it in a way that I previously thought might destroy it. I've clocked some 57 hours into the game so far and I'm mostly only played as the empire. I've played a touch of the vampire counts and the dwarves and I have to say I'm extremely excited to play through with them.  The one thing old total war users may want to take into account is that this game is intentionally streamlined in some ways. For instance the settlement management is much easier to use. You don't have to balance food and sanitation (thank God) public order still exists but it is very easy to maintain. There aren't tons of units for each race. Some races have more units, some have less. However there is still strong rosters for each. Personally I really enjoy this feature of the game because I can focus on experimenting with the different combinations (all hail griffin calv).  If you've played either warhammer or total war I really suggest you try this game out. It is a really nice segway into either franchise.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"In light of CA's DLC policy of charging rediculous amounts of money to add features that should already be in place when the game launches, I have changed my review from positie to negative. Paying $18.99 for a SINGLE RACE DLC is pathetic. What a greedy bunch of losers. This game was far from complete when it released and now I'm being asked to buy the remaining peices of the puzzle in $18.99 increments? Forget it! Luckily I didn't have to pay $7.99 to unlock the chaos faction (which is already a part of the game) because I pre-ordered the game, but it's stupid that others did have to pay for it. I did buy the gore pack because playing a total war game without blood just doesn't make sense. But that was only $3.00. I can understand paying $3.00 for a DLC, not $18.99. No freakin way. This crap has GOT to stop. There are tons of DLCs left to come and if this is what they are going to be charging then I'm done with this game, I'm done with Creative Assembly, and I'm done with Total War.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is very addicting, to the point that I purposely stopped myself once I started consistently playing. The first ten hours of course were a terrible experience of learning basics and then eventually trying to apply them in an online match only to be yelled at and insulted continuously. However eventually you'll get a little better and then you will become that person screaming and yelling at all the 'scrubs' instead of helping them learn. The game itself is amazing, the strategy and gameplay are fantastic and you can choose from over one hundred characters. The UI is very streamlined and the controls prove clean and responsive. Overall I stopped because I could tell the game was about to take over my life in a very bad way, but if you have the time and some friends it's a rewarding if not toxic experience.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I made a review before and only 20% of the people found it to be helpful. I looked at it and saw points for improvement and I wanted to write a helpful review so this is my second attempt.  I start to say again that the game and all it's DLC's if you bought them are pretty awesome. I only know the DLC's from youtube and frankly I don't see myself investing 120 euro's in a game to buy the DLC's and the main game (at least not these DLC's). For example the option gore as in blood effects is a DLC priced at 2,5 euro's. Most of the other DLC's are also overpriced in my opinion.  If you are like my and don't want to buy every DLC (this) premium price I would advise you not to buy this game. There are no discounts in this game for DLC or the main game so far in its existence. Total war used to have discounts but for this game they seemed to have scrapped that to only pre-order 10% discount for DLC's. Also members of total war can give 20% discounts for the major game. However and here comes my main point if you buy the main game the AI will get access to all DLC and this will destroy the balance in the game between the races.   For example the King and Warlord DLC creates new units, buildings and legendary lords for Greenskins and Dwarfes. It also creates for all races regiments of renown. These regiments of renown will be your main problem. Below the review is the explanation of Total War themselves about regiments of renown. If you do not buy these DLC even if you only bought the main game these units will feature in it. The AI will use these units and while you can only upgrade your units to a certain point the AI will recruit regminets of renown which are far superior to your troops. Making it so that on very hard mode or legendary mode the victories become phyrric even if you field 4 armies against 3 (in my experience) or you will start losing and you need to build off on your early game blitzkrieg to have an extra army or 2 that is razing their lands while you slow down their armies while they advance upon you. It certainly adds a new part of strategy but mainly you as the underdog and the AI as the more advanced nation with the bigger stick all the while you are frustrated at Total War because you bought the main game and were perfectly happy with it without them wrecking that experience with their DLC's. I would advise if you still buy the game without DLC's to not play the lategame after you collected the achievements. Just make a calculation if I had the DLC's I would have ended turn 150-200 without DLC's it can become a furious struggle till 300 turns without much pleasure from it (at least that's my experience). You can ofcourse lower the difficulty setting but I have played total war since shogun original and I don't want to lower the setting, I just want a fair game.  REGIMENTS OF RENOWN  These are elite units – legendary within the annals of the Old World – whose statistics are much-improved over those of their standard counterparts. They can be unlocked for recruitment when the Lord under your command has attained the sufficient skill level, and are instantly recruited from the special Regiments of Renown recruitment menu into his army. In this respect they differ from standard units, which spend at least one turn in the recruitment queue.  Alongside enhanced stats and top-tier (level 9) veterancy, each Regiment of Renown also has one or more special abilities its standard-roster counterpart does not.  Missing these regiments of renown is very hard but the fact that the AI in the single player campaign also has access units that complement his roster better than your faction roster gives rise to frustration. I play a game for fun. I don't pay 60 euro's on a main game so later on the people of Total War can ruin my single player campaign with DLC's you can't opt out off. Plx Total War give me an option to start the game without the influence of DLC's I don't have. I payed good money for this game..    Other flaws in my opinion:  The serious flaw of the game if you buy the DLC is the hero and lord skills. It is copy past and some order changes but it's almost all the same. Very unimaginative and also most skills are useless. Sometimes you have to select 6 times something you don't want to get the thing you do want and with only 30 skill points 6 is a heavy investment. It seriously needs a revamp with each hero having some individual magics and skills. So you actually have a choice what to make of your hero. Now most of the skills are not very usefull and so you always select the ones that are (with the obligated ones to get there) and that's it. It's not the choice of making a strong magic user lord, battle lord, general who drives his troops to new heights or administrative lord.  The amount of mana available during a battle is dissapointing. I get that they wanted to preserve the total war experience which i value very highly but now we know it's a great game. Make it great with magics. If you want to preserve what you have it can simply be a button at the start of the campaign that you can click on if you want some heavy magic damage (although i think the enemy needs to be able to counter some magic two at that point).",-1,0,0

It does have that button in the corner of the window to maximize it. To bad i couldn't get to it because the mouse wouldn't come out of the window. That wasn't so much a problem as the sensitivity not feeling right (i did change it, a lot). Then the first server i got on i got kicked for being afk. The only reason i was afk was because i died and was spectating. But still the worst part a about this game experience was that no matter what game mode i played my team would spawn kill me. And i don't have the patience to be team spawn killed until i get to a point where i could actually get a feel for the game. Again it might be a good game and i would have bought it (i tried on free weekend) it it wasn't for the team killing.    6.5/10 too much team killing",-1,0,0

The game is much simpler than previous Total War games with entire gameplay mechanics removed from the final product. On top of this, Creative Assembly have decided they are going to release entire DLCs dedicated to adding in factions (which should have been in the game to begin with) as well as the option to show gore in your game... seriously, they expect you to pay to tweak your gore-settings.

Virtually anyone can create mods and new levels for the game. All you need is the Unreal Development Kit, and a few video tutorials on how to use it and write in Unreal Script.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 is a game full of surprises and suspense, backed up with an interesting story and addictive gameplay, it's a no brainer for anyone who is a fan of open world, story driven RPGs. I've put thousands of hours into this game on my Xbox (before I stopped being a filthy console peasant), and a few hundred on my PC (Using a custom launcher that for some reason didn't add play time to steam), and not a single minute was wasted.   The game follows the main protagonist, a vault dweller, whose father had committed the cardinal sin of leaving the vault to venture into the irradiated nuclear wasteland for an unknown purpose. The vault dweller, shunned by the other members of the vault and at risk of being killed as punishment for his/her father's crime, is forced to flee after their father into the harsh and unforgiving 'Capital Wasteland' to search for answers. The player is free to adventure across the vast wasteland surrounding post apocalyptic Washington DC, meeting slavers, bandits, mutated creatures and other survivors. There are countless settlements, derelict buildings, caves, underground train networks etc to explore, each containing their own piece of back story and perils, ranging from a renovated tower full of 'privileged' people who live above a network of ghouls who want nothing more than to get in, to the withered remains of the white house or the DC monument.  Following the main questline is recommended but not essential, and there are hundreds of side quests to follow, unique items to collect and moral dilemmas at every turn (such as whether to detonate a nuclear bomb killing an entire town of people for cash or not). If you've seen the recent announcement of Fallout 4 and wasn't sure if spending £49.99 on the pre order is a good idea, buy this game and put some time into it. It's made by Bethesda, a company renowned for the Elder Scrolls series of games, so if you are a fan of those, chances are, you'll be a fan of this!",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"Absolutely horrible game that will move any rational, grown person to instantly leave solely because of how terrible the game community is. This game is plagued by 12-16 year olds like League of Legends, and in almost every match you'll find yourself getting angry because you are teamed with kiddies who only care about themselves getting a good score, and not about winning the actual match.  The worst encounters are those where you are matched with a group of kids who will do anything to blame you because 'lel its funny xDDDD' and because 'ura bad omg dude y u no gief me rune?? :(((('  The worst is this pro-feminism, pro-'racial mixing' that Steam is forcing upon its mindless consumers.  If you do not submit yourself to 'le cool gurl gaimer xDDDD' on your team then you're a sexist and 'omg ban dis guy omg he offen me :(((,' and if you call those poor Asians or Africans for a word that describes them, then you're a racist and 'omg ura a racist omg ban dis guy :((('  So, let's recap: Community consists largely of 12-16 year old 'cool' gamers. Players are often so challenged that they are incapable of seeing what's in their best self-interest. Not submitting yourself to inferior players (female, autistic, etc.) means you're a bad person and Gayben is personally going to punish you for not agreeing with The New Standards that Steam is enforcing upon people.",-1,0,0

The game started off pretty strong, I really liked the part where you grow up and escape the vault, however, the fun pretty much stopped after that point. Exploring must be the most boring part of the game: you move at a snail's pace towards newer locations and once you found them, you'll be doing nothing but quick travelling back and forth between a big city and your current location, because I found myself over encumbered and low on ammo all the time... It's a shame, since I really like the setting of the post apocalyptic world. Furthermore, quests appeared to be very dull, item management is a nightmare (yet there's tons of stuff to loot) and ammo can be scarce at the start.

265930,Goat Simulator,"Thoroughly enjoyed Goat Simulator 2014. Goat/10. Goat Simulator 2014 gives an in-depth experience that uses a wide range of engaging stimulus and challenges to educate us humans of the agricultural environment that a goat must endure through it's life. The inspiring story of Goat overcoming his/her oppressors (the humans) creates an amazing storyline, with numerous plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know what you're thinking, 'but its just a goat!' Shut the hell up you fool, although this may be 'just a goat', this is 'just a goat' that broke through its goat expectations and stereotypes to face the world with nothing but its hyper-elastic tongue and it's oddly unnatural ability to not die. Ever. Goat Simulator 2014 expertly demonstrates how political views and actions can affect not only mankind, but also goats. It confronts the player with many terrifying situations (and can at times cause great offense). One example of this is the many rules and regulations imposed by the goverment, like what the hell? You want to keep me in this goat pen? Do you think this tower will keep me happy? This game allows you to fight the power, and essentially '♥♥♥♥ the police'. The most controversial aspect of this game is most definitely the goat fight scene, where you must turn against your fellow goats for the pleasure of the humans. Who really wants to participate in a competitive blood bath of goats for someone else's entertainment? In my honest opinion, I would much rather prefer that to not be a part of the game. Although I may not be condoning goat on goat violence, I find mowing down the many so called 'innocent' civilians and sacrificing them to the Lord Satan gives me an enjoyable rush. This game has the potential to inspire many, whether they want to become a goat scientist, goat gymnast, goat astronaut, goat ball pitcher or whale, they will find this game absolutely enthralling. The Good Goat VS Bad Goat dynamic of Goat Simulator gives the player the ability to influence the goat's decisions, and essentially determine to be Good Goat, or Bad Goat. (I also have the sneaking suspicions that recent games such as Infamous: SECOND SUN (what does that even mean?) have copied this genius game mechanic from Goat Simulator 2014.)    I recommend this game as it accurately depicts the various aspects of survival that a goat must face in it's day to life, and does so in a way that us humans can relate to and take advice from in both an entertaining and interesting way. This game forces you to think. I love it. ",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"This game is INSANELY fun! I've had so much fun playing this game with its IMMENSE battles, HUGE maps, and fun to drive vehicles!

One gun usually costs the equivlent of $5 but all of them look THE EXACT SAME! To get a custom skin it would cost you an extra $2 in certs so that's $7 JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LOOKING GUN! Then there's the half ♥♥♥♥♥ character customization but that's not really worth much of a rant because you don't pay attention to character detail when you're in a 200 vs 200 battle(and trust me there is gonna be one of those). Just to have a decent start at the game you'd probably have to give up $20... but you can get all of that for free, however it would take you an incredibly long time.

I couldn't play the game very well using a controller, since there are so many buttons to bind. Maybe a Steam Controller, but not a DualShock or Xbox. Even after binding most of the important ones, it seems as though the turning speed of a character was far too fast. I couldn't find any setting to lower this.  Additionally, I even encountered bugs through the tutorial section that would not let me complete the tutorial without restarting the game. From menus not opening (even after pressing the corresponding button on the keyboard rather than a controller) to targets not registering the kills.  Overall, I truly had a terrible experience.

Click to do damage, to get money, to hire 'heroes' that do the damage for you. The hero you hire does damage up to a certain stage. All you have to do then, is wait till you... well basically it, has killed enough creatures, thus earning you money, for you to hire the next hero. You also face a boss fight every five stages (each stage has ten creatures).   Boss fights are nothing more than a magnified creature, you have seen before, that has tons of life and runs on a timer. Bosses might give you “Hero Souls” if they are “Primal Bosses” and only after stage 100. That’s it. Rinse and repeat. You will be doing the exact same thing from stages 1 to 10 to infinity. Of course the gap between the cost of heroes at some point increases to a point where you can’t reach it, so you “Ascend,” meaning you get to start all over again. Sure you get some “Hero Souls” that give you 10% increased damage per HS, or you can use them to 'summon' Ancients that buff every aspect of what you are, actually NOT doing. All in order to make that gap smaller, so you can hire the next hero. Only to find out that the next hero after the one you just hired requires even more money, proportionally. So you ascend again.   At some point all you have to do is let the software run by itself and you will achieve all there is to achieve. You do get some bonuses from the “Achievements”. It might take you… oh, about 174 hours to get the kill 1500K Achievement, if you leave the software running non stop. It might look like a nice game at first, where you can maybe achieve some goals with your skills, but it soon turns into a case study of “how can we make people do menial tasks with no gain whatsoever”. Also there is little clicking involved, especially if you don't care about the achievements.   Seriously, play something else if you need to fill the need of accomplishing things or the need to check on something. Better yet go outside and meet people.  P.S. There are auto clickers and save game editors out there, that nullify this softwares’ already meaningless existence.  Valar avoidis.",-1,0,0

I have a choice of giving everything up and starting over or simply do not play.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I found Far Cry's story really boring. It was just dull and the boss fight's were very anti-climatic. The only boss fight that wasn't a quick-time event that I recall is the one where you fight the giant with weird tentacle looking hair, but I found the even more boring because your just shooting arrows at its face. I even found the mission where you burn'd the crops annoying and boring. I can tell it was trying to be cool and fun by giving you a flame thrower with dubstep music in the background but whenever I tried burning stuff I was gunned down by ♥♥♥♥ing heavies with mini-guns. So I had to continually run behind cover and suck my thumb until my wounds went away, and I constantly ran out of ammo so I had to keep going into ♥♥♥♥ing buildings to search for ammo.   The main part that I found fun about Far Cry 3 was the fact that it was open worldish. I enjoyed going to the outposts and taking them over, I do wish however that the enemy's would counterattack after you have taken it over because once you take over a outpost it just becomes an eternal base which you just use occasionally to fast travel to. I found taking over outposts so much fun, once I lost some progress to a mission I was working on (it didn't save properly) so I just went taking over outposts one by one until I cleared the entire island. I then noticed a island which was untouched by me so I go to it and then game stops me and say's I'm out of bounds or something and teleported me back. This island later became unlocked when I finished the missions I needed to finish but I found it very annoying how I was constantly teleported back.  All in all I loved Far Cry 3 besides the boss fights being anti-climatic and the story being boring I found the free roaming fun and what really sold me on the game was being able to take over outposts anyway you want, either it being from a sniper, completely stealthing it and taking out the guards one by one, or just going it guns blazing. I also liked the upgrades and how they made you into a bad ♥♥♥ mofo and how each upgrade was a tatoo displayed on your arm which I found was a very nice touch.

570,Dota 2,"I find this game design is too ornate. There are many systems in it which don't support the core of the game, which is 'I work with my team to assault the enemy base in order to destroy the Ancient'.  As this is based on the tower defence genre, last-hitting creeps is a source of income. The bit that's extraneous is last-hitting your own creeps to deny your opponents getting them.  The courier animal system feels extraneous to me.  Other issues include an announcer that makes me feel like I'm a third grader, map legibility issues, and balance issues. By balance I mean that when you die, you get penalized more than is necessary: not only do you lose the time you spend dead, but you lose some of your cash when you die.  I think in creating this game the designers shackled themselves too closely to the old Warcraft III mod, when they should have been finding ways to refine and streamline the game.  It's not that there isn't a game here to be played and learned and enjoyed. But there are far better MOBAs out there.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Haloish mmofps. Massive world to get in to many different firefights of all kinds in is a BIG draw for me and has kept me interested even against the pay to win aspects of this game. Running 1000km to the next base to take, seeking cover under trees from enemy jets flying over while dodging sniper shots from who friggin knows where feels just as crazy as it sounds. Standing atop an outpost and spraying out mass quantities of lead at an organized assault bent on smearing your team all over the walls is a great feeling, even if you lose. Everything in between these examples is possible. The varying terrain is easily this games biggest draw for me, and all of it lumped together in one continuous world is terrific. Instant action and squad support keep you in the fight too, so you are never looking for the next battle for long. Problems: A little on the pay to win side. Looks like the most powerful equipment and weapons are strictly $$ purchases and even if the in game items are close, there still lies some favor in those paying the money. Looking past this i adopted an unorthodox style of deception and being in places im not expected to be to make up for the lack of firepower. Pay2win solved. Ill go 80/100 for this one.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Having played all the Total War games, I can safely say that, for me, this is the worst Total War game of all time. I'll admit that I am biased against non-historical titles, but I will make sure to focus this review only on the gameplay problems which I encountered.  In terms of battle experience, the battles happen extremely quickly, far too quickly for my liking. This means that the result of a battle is largely decided by unit volume and stats rather than by tactical maneuvers. The hero and general units make battles even worse. On one occasion, I had won a tactical victory, routing a superior enemy army. However, the enemy general, the only remaining enemy, defeated all of my remaining units, even when they were attacking him from all sides.  I found the campaign map to be too limited, with few expansion patterns available to the player. This is made even worse by the feature which prevents certain factions from capturing either cities or holds. Also, the lack of navies really limits the gameplay style options.  The rosters of many factions seem to be distinguished by the lack of a crucial unit type, which means most of your campaign strategy revolves around compensating for tactical inflexibilities. The dwarves lack cavalry, the vampires lack missile units. This really limits what army types you can field, meaning that building armies is largely about volume rather than quality.  Another thing to mention is the new seige mechanics, which further reduce the tactical options by forcing the player to deploy at the city walls and charge immediately, due to the arrow towers. The town battles have also been removed, for no apparent reason, reducing tactial variety even further.  To sum up this game - it is severely lacking in variety and flexibility, both in a strategic and tactical sense. It is a betrayal of the core fanbase of Total War, who were drawn to the title for the unrivaled tactical flexibility which the battles offered.",-1,1,0

Archery is only based on a little on skill and alot by luck, the arrows move at a wopping 3 meters an hour, so aiming at a moving target is like throwing a rock at a bird, sure you can get better than some people at it but you're never really 'good'. Man-at-arms is a class of speed and the only class with the 'dodge' ability, also, the most over powered class. When playing as a man-at-arms your strategy is dodge forward, hit, the dodge backward, no skill really required. Vanguard is the best of both worlds class, except not. Vanguard is the only class without the sheild but with the longest weapons, balanced right? No, with vanguard after you run around for a bit you get and extra damage buff, walk up behind someone and one shot them, no skill required. Knight is the heavy hitter class, a class with weapons that do alot of damage, but have the length of almost nothing, basically the short end of the stick, skill required but you're at such a disadvantage why even try. The classes are unbalanced, but the mechanics are worse.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"This game is beautiful, the combat mechanics are awesome, and its fun - for a little while. As so many others have said, I really WANT to like it. I wish I could give it 3 of 5 stars instead of a simple yes or no.   What it lacks is a larger purpose: its pointless.  There's virtually no social aspect, no significant levelling system, and no 'grand map.'    There's no overall leaderboard, except during an individual battle, and no way to see a history of who you've killed or vice versa. The only way to check your stats is to get out of the game and into your computer to open an .ini text file, which only shows how many total kills you have by weapon.    Points and Rank mean nothing (except for unlocking a few relatively insignificant weapons early on).   There is no 'grand map,' so you gain nothing whether your team wins or loses; just jump into the next battle - switching teams if you like - and do it all over again, and then again.   Why?",-1,0,0
220240,Far Cry® 3,This is a great game. Too bad I could't finish it. There is a scene where Jason and Buck are in a knife fight. There are a series of mouse and keyboard strokes necessary to win the fight for Jason. When I come to a particular keystroke it does not display so that I can then push it ... so Jason loses. The game cannot proceed beyond this point. Looking online shows this is a BUG others have experienced. Youtube videos of this particular scene show the letter onscreen. I have not found a work-a-round and Ubisoft has not offered a fix. I don't know why some have the bug as I do and others do not. My rig is 2 X 680 GTX in SLI with 3 monitors in surround. Bug still occurs when the game is in 1900 X 1080. Can't recommend game because I can't finish it.,-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"This is my favourite game of all time. I have hundreds of hundreds of hours on this game from both console and when I had it installed as a non Steam game and I will have hundreds of hours more having just reinstalled it through Steam after losing my old version in a new Windows install.  This game is pretty broken without some tweaking, but once tweaked it is well worth the effort and I found the DLCs to be enjoyable and a good value. I love the setting in this game and can just happily get lost for hours wondering DC.  The game of course really comes into it's own after you've made your tweaks and start to install some of the many hundreds of excellent mods out there for this game, ranging from the smallest changes to huge DLC scale additions. There are a ton of guides and hidden gems to find which will teach you about the best way to tweak the game and install mods and after spending many (or few) boring hours reading and collecting your mods you will see for yourself that it is well, well worth it.  This game is better now than it has ever been and a few hours invested in setting it up (I know this sounds horrible*) will really pay off.  *You don't have to spend this long if you don't want to but to become really well informed on how to tweak and mod Fallout in an efficient and stable way then it will take this long but it IS worth it as it will completely transform the game in nearly any way you want.",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,Great game although with the new DLC I can't say that you should buy it I love the game and me and my friend have been playing the heck out of it but 20$ for one faction and a mini campaign... Come on CA respect your fan base.,-1,1,0
265930,Goat Simulator,"First off, this game is funny if you have my sense of humor... for about 12 minutes. Then it becomes boring. The workshop items don't help at all, too. Also, this is way overpriced. I mean WAY... 10 FREAKING BUCKS? It should be about 0.99-2.49 for the short gameplay. All I'm saying is that you are wasting money if you buy this. Please, PLEASE listen to my advice, and spend/save your money up for something good... like StarBound... or Garry's Mod... or even ( Ecleast it's better than this ) Crysis 2. Ok, never mind, forget that. Never buy Crysis 2 either, its fun for 20 minutes until you meet aliens, then they're too OP and impossible to kill. But my point is, is that everyone who says ' OMGZ SO LOL LOL LOL FLY GOAT OMG PEWDS PLAYED IT!!!!111 HAZ TOO B3 GOOD,' are people that either (A : Just watched Pewds play it (or Markiplier) (B : Haven't actually played it but bought it, or (C Have a dumb sense of humor. If you look at most helful reviews, the people who 'Thumbs Up'd for Helpfulness' Haven't even played the game yet, and they think it's good because Pewds played it. (BTW Wanna see how that cycle works? Check out Gametheory, they made an episode of how GS [Goat Simulator] became so popular and other stuff)   Just press the button 'Only Negative' in the review section, and then you'll change your mind. Trust me, its good for 12 minutes, then its boring. Its just 'BL0W UPZ GOAT, WUTCH POODEEPIE, BUY GAME, WUTCH POODIEPIE, PLAY GAME, CRY THAT YOU WASTED MONEY'. Thats the cycle of GS. Thank you for your time, and please do not buy this game. Thank you.   And remember this for other games, so-called 'Bro's', (BTW I dont hate pewdiepie, Im a bro too, but just not a stupid one) just because Pewds played, or any other youtuber played it, and they made you laugh, doesn't mean the game is funny. It just means the Youtuber is funny. So sure, hate on this review because of the 'OMFG DIS GUIY STOOPID, HE HATEZ PEWDIEPIE, I HATE HIM, DISLIKE 4EVAR BEETCH!!!!', just dont buy the game. Maybe if It ever goes on sale for 2.49, but not for 10, not even 4.99. So please, get Hitman Absolution when it's on sale instead of GS, or get Sleeping Dogs, or Tomb Raider, or even Rust. But, I have some final notes for games you SHOULD BUY.   Shouldn't:  Turbo Dismount |OMFGGZ PWED PLAYZ IT, I LUVZ IT!!!  Crysis 2 | Please God, I'd rather kill myself.|  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Should:  Any indie game, you may think it's stupid or unpopular, or not Pewd's worthy, but Sleeping Dogs was amazing. And I mean AMAZING.  Broforce |One of the few games Pewds played that was good, not much gameplay, but awesomely fun, with all the updates.|  Tomb Raider |Main Story is ok, but Multiplayer is awesome.  Hitman Absolution |Lots of game play if you're a determined gamer to get acheivements, with awesome Campaign|    Good bye everyone. Please vote yes on 'Helpful', so I can spread the message. ",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I waited to do this review to see how the DLCs were going to be.  First I started playing Warhammer in 1994 and Total War when Shogun (The First One) came out. This combination I have been wanting to happen for a long time and could have been a great game but it is far from it.   Total War games have continued to remove the strategic elements from the game and primarily just focus on the battles. This is ok for some players but not for me. So individuals that prefer a tactical setting will like this game. Those that grew up with complexity of Rome 1 you will have the same feeling as you did when Rome 2 came out.   The DLCs have continued to anger many gamers including myself but I do understand that making video games is a business. So if this approach is working then continue, I only ask that 'they' look at the long term vs the short term business goals and ask will it be worth it.  So the only thing that I can do as a consumer is, write this review and promise that I am done buying Total War games. It is sad because I truly did enjoy teaching younger gamers how to play Rome 1.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Do not try this game, as in many fascets in FPS.....this one has a imaginative and interesting concept that does not compare to other games of similar standards. First, alot of people are stating online that this game does not have a large amount of cheaters or hackers which is a huge lie. Hacking is very present in this game with people claiming maxed sensitivity and some fancy setting which still negates the speed of such weapon. Even if you catch such people commiting these actions there are numerous others that ruin the experiance of a game. Second, friendly fire is very present in the game.....be it does put a sense of realism in the game it also breeds a form of elitist mentality in a large sum of the player base toward the newer players in whch you are eithier be trolled out of game or more often kicked and unable to rejoin toward the more populated servers where the game was in one prospective interesting. Lastly, the progression systems for unlocking weapons is based solely on aggregated kills and not on kills that was helped as in other games. Many times while you are in combat a veteran players or at times a newer player will come in while in 1V1 combat take or steal ones kill and make you progression most tedious especially toward weaker weapons that do not kill in one or 2 hits similar that plaques the lighter classes. There are things in game that has some moments but these few times of brightness gets mostly overcasted by constant hacking, lag issues and lack of overall progression in which random interjections in combat by other players ruin the experiance.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"TLDR? Too Bad. :)  I don't think enough negative reviews capture the actual 'Do Not Recommend' concept. Instead, you get a group of ticked off people that simply down vote a game for the price and DLCs. While, I also believe the price point was not acceptable nor are the DLCs with all of them commanding $18.99 and $7.99. I at least waited until it was 25% off, so I'm somewhat happy, kind of.  Now to the game. I had some fun and feel I got my money's worth with over 64 hours of gameplay to date. I will most likely go back and play it again at some point out of boredom. The game has a lot of interesting unit, class, and strategy combinations to choose from, but ultimately I really think the game is lacking.  Pros to consider: - All the races play slightly different while others play VERY different, which provides you with a good amount of re-playability. In previous Total War games, I felt, everything looked more or less the same. In TW: WH, the feel is truly different. - Good amount of army customization but if you want to make or paint your own army, you're out of luck. - Hero, unit, and city naming customization. In addition to item and trait customization for the heroes. While they do not “display” anything on the field, like a new shield, but the customizing is very cool.  I do not recommend because: - One Map (not battle map). We get one map with fixed locations and no ability to mix the starting locations up outside of a campaign mode or create your own map. Honestly. Lord of the Realms 2 which released in 1996 has this function. Its absence seems shoddy. - Quests are overly random and don't make sense. The story kicks off for each race very well and from an RPG standpoint the game kicks off very awesome. What I don't like is the campaign just randomly gives you objectives like; hey kill your ally and get 1500 gold/power/whatever and if you don't you failed the quest! Or how about sack the enemy strong hold in 5 turns and you’ll get 500 gold! While there are not normally repercussions for ignoring a quest. I find it truly moronic. - Random World War 3 in the onset of the Chaos Horde. After several play-throughs, it seems to be programed into the game to absolutely have the world implode when the notification that the Chaos army is on the move. Allies go nuts and attack you. Dormant “I did nothing to you the entire time in the game from across the map” now attack for no darn reason at all. All of them, just gang you. BTW-Chaos horde is coming. Stupid IMHO. If it happened once, cool, that was a nightmare. But all 4 times for me so far. - It is only about the Chaos. Literally the game—every freaking game you start regardless of race is about the darn Chaos. There is no other objective to this game but live long enough to kill Chaos/meet victory objectives. Maybe I want there to be a Wood Elf army on the move next time? And maybe the 3rd time I don’t want one at all. I just want to see if everyone can go ten turns without being bi-polar. - The politics of Total War continues to be a disaster. They did make some serious progress in politics making sense, but it still is just not there yet. If the game is built on Low, Moderate, High I would expect there to be X-% of success based on each level. So far, I have not seen one “Low” get accepted. Why not just say “No, Maybe, Yes” because that is what it is. - On a technical stand point it is not a smooth ride for your system. I have several computers varying in age and while all of them meet and exceed the system requirements, only the brand new computer runs this game without performance drops. Random lag, crashing, freezing, ect. were evident.  Kind of a negative, but mostly personal issues. - Graphically, it doesn't look all that nice. Not to me anyways, I feel like it could have been better. - I don't like the race locking for city ownership. I know some people think it brings to balance the game, but I honestly don't like it. I think you could maybe go at an angle of living in a non-racial area effects happiness, ect. Not something I would 'not recommend' the game over though. - Back to this. Ultimately, it comes down to kicking the Choas' butt and if you had a bad start, got into a war that you really shouldn't of or if your units are not top notch, you're dead. 3 chaos Armies took out 7 of mine (not wimpy) on the auto-resolve. Now while there is a going to be the classic, 'get gud, WHAAGH!', ect comments and “play the battle you jack-tard”. I simply look at the auto resolve calculator and believe if you do not fight the battles and get really good at them before Chaos arrives, auto calculator is most likely not going to work for you (significant variables apply and I was the first army they met out of the chaos valley). I personally don't like the battles and prefer the 'Risk' aspect of the game. But that is just me. I think the functionality of auto resolve should work continuously. I have played ambush battles and turned the loss into a win, but some dumb luck. - And yes the game is incomplete and placed behind an entertainment pay-wall. Remember when you bought a game and you got the whole thing? I do. You make the call on the pricing, but I won't buy any of this franchise not on sale at 25% or more for the main game. Probably 50-75%+ for the DLCs.  Thanks!",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Despite being my favorite game of the past year, I still have to agree that Planetside 2 has one of the most difficult learning curves to pass in a game. For new players interested in trying out this game, I recommend expecting to die more than kill initially. However, the sheer scale of combat makes for an amazing display. I remember when I first started playing, I joined a battle spanning several territories-- Huge lines of tanks were exchanging fire as aircraft swooped through the chaos. It was an amazing introduction to the game, but not an exclusive one. Ps2 contains some of the most expansive, strategic, and intense fights I've experienced in the FPS genre. Progression through upgrades feeks rewarding, and there is no 'Pay to win' option for those who choose to spend money. I personally recommend trying to help your team before you start doing hilariously insane things (Like my outfit does). Overall, there are hundreds of ways to play the game, depending on what class, loadout, and customization you choose, which evolves over time as you earn more items. There will be times where you get tired of playing, then immediately get back into the game because you've discovered a new and effective way to fight. Conclusively, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants an FPS that they can enjoy for a very long time.   TL;DR-- Planetside 2 is an MMOFPS that both captures the massive scale of battle and gives options to the micro scale of each individual player.",1,1,1

Other than that, this game has all the right ideas. A fluid and dynamic combat system and the right mix of class based action and vehicle combat. Having a battle with over 200 people is amazing, and with dogfighting in the air above, and a Galaxy or two dropping reinforcements in from from the skies, this game has so much to offer.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"An excellent game that is very fun to play with your friends. Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a lot different than most first person games, as you need to think and focus on what you are doing in order to counter and defeat your opponents. You need to focus on working around their defenses and attacking when their block is down, while focusing on your own defense. This is an amazing game that is worth your time. But this game really shines when you play with your friends. The satisfaction of dominating your friends and seeing them fall before you gives you a satisfaction you don’t get in many other games, because when you defeat them, you know it wasn’t because of a cheap shot or they caught you when you weren’t expecting it, you defeated them because you planned your attacks better, were swifter then them, and defeated them with your own skills. This makes this game extremely fun, and with the addition of customizing your own knights to your liking, makes you a one of a kind fighter in this amazing game. The only down side is to truly get the most out of the game, you need to play for a long time to unlock all of your weapons, as some very useful 3rd weapons need to be unlocked as you level up, but it isn’t anything game breaking. For $25 it is a pretty good deal, for all the fun you get when playing with your friends, but if you can find this game on sale, it would be for the better.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I really enjoy RTS Games, however this is my first Total War exprience. I'm used to a overhead view and micro managment of units, this was an entirely different exprience then I expected. If you haven't played one of these before, it's going to take quite a bit of time and research to understand to move foward. Once I invested a decent chunk of time on learning the system and what everything is I was able to expand and move forward and make progress.   There really isn't any story line or end of the progression, while you can messure your success each day the value of it demishes rapidly and performing any action or battle becomes mondain and boring, that is to say for me anyway.   The game is quite polished and feels complete. The Tutorial needs a great deal of work for those that is not going to invest the required time as I did to get going (if you haven't played a Total war game). But if you want a never ending game that you play for a few hours or a whole weekend for as long as you desire, this game has some great longivity. The Graphics, the races and terrain layout look excellent.   I'm a bit bais on the battles, I enjoy a good fight to the death. This, the battle is over in a short time and the enemy unit flees and get's away. That takes a lot out of it for me.   If a demo isn't availible I watch quite a few youtube videos before making the investment. All the videos the players seeemd quite pleased and enjoyed the game, it's likely you could do the same. For me, It just doesn't do anything for me, I really had my heart set on it, I'd like to a find a new RTS that is more current and pleasing such as some of the graphics this game offers.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I returned the game because whilst it is a good concept the graphics and animations (and therefore overall feel of polish and production value) were not just a step back from previous games, but in my opinion worse than the last four total war games including Napoleon Total War. In fact the quality of the animations and models reminded me of medieval 2 more than anything else, and pale in comparison to shogun 2. I dont have an issue with this per se as janky animations and poor model and texture quality do not a good game make, but if youre looking at the full 60$ asking price you better bet that comes into consideration. To be perfectly honest this game simply does not have the production value of a 60$ total war game.  The massive step backwards in AI group behavior, unit interaction animations, and unit diversity (in terms of model design), as well as lack of detail in battle maps and environments has left the product feeling cheapened and not worth full asking price. This is a shame as the concept was good, and implemented well.  I dont recomend this game for the price they currently ask",-1,0,0

Some people think that the lack of fine polish and poor optimization adds to the game, but it really doesn't for me. Perhaps it's just because it's still being developed and patched, but it certainly didn't make for a super enjoyable experience for me. Either way, the net experience was definitely more positive -- the game is creative and fun, with all sorts of cultural references sprinkled in.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Do I recommend this game? NO! Looking at other reviews I can not believe this broken thing has gotten so much praise, it's a very interesting concept but it was impossible for me to get into it. The tutorial is broken, the difficulty is broken, the difficulty could have been forgiven though IF THE FREAKING BLOCKING WASN'T BROKEN. When I finally got into the menu after ten minutes of waiting for the game to start up (I honestly don't know if that was due to my Windows 8 HP 2000 laptop or the game) I was immediately disappointed by the customization, again, wondering how it got so much praise as I'm typing this, with no customization to your guy's body whatsoever, and then the armors look near identical, and you have to buy most of them. When I got into the tutorial after 5 mins of waiting, I was faced with the simple task of blocking this really annoying captain's attack. That took 20 minutes. Yes it's that broken. Especially if you're a veteran Elder Scrolls player. After finally succeeding I had to go through tons of anger-producing bullcrap. Oh you fight enemies in the tutorial. Sounds cool, right? No they will slaughter you. I had to run in circles plenty of times in those fights. When I survived that nonsense, I tried to join two games. First time, it loaded me as god mode in a super buggy map, only other 'people' to be found was two troops running in place. Second time, it loaded me right next to a river, where I couldn't move, attack, or look around. I was forced to stare at a river. Couldn't even try the 3rd time cause it froze. The game in general is laggy(could be my system) and doesn't have the worst graphics I've seen, but they definitely could be better, way better.If the above sounds nice to you, especially if you're looking for a challenge, then I guess the game is for you.

The only time i disliked the game was the buying proccess itself, because i forgot my steam username, and nearly couldnt get the game and lost ten dollars. But the game itself is totally worth it, just dont preorder it like i did unless you are used to the humble bundle-store-thing and are confident you can do it.  [EDIT] The days when I wrote that review... Those were different times.   baaasically I was an idiot who got too distracted by the game's silly bugs to notice that the game was nothing BUT silly bugs. It's trash. There's no depth, there's very little game, and the only reason I managed to reach 22 hours of playtime on this game before realising it was a piece of complete and utter garbage is because I had a friend come over a lot and we took turns playing it. If you're willing to spend 10 buckaroos for, if you're older than 12, maybe 20 minutes of fun, then go right ahead (despite that thing about splitting time, I still have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue how I managed to play that much of it before realising it was horrible). It's a dumb, broken game. That's it. It's marketed as a dumb, broken game, it acknowledges that a lot in game, and once you realise that, rather than a dev working to make it wacky and fun, to at least be slapstick comedy, it was just that the dev couldn't bother to actually make it better. Then, upon realising that it was irredemably ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they just rolled with it, and came out on top - gathering the attention of millions of children, a couple youtubers who'se audiences ARE children, and a few unlucky people like me who were blinded by all the publicity it got from youtubers, and thought that maybe it had some depth.    Wait this game is years old and hype for it died out pretty soon after release. Whatever. Back to getting super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at toxic jerks on Overwatch (an infinitely better game.)",-1,0,0

TW:Warhammer is a great combination of TW and the Warhammer franchise, CA has done a great job of bringing this rich world to the video game scene with awesome models, abilities, and animations. Throw that in with the promise that all factions will be represented by the end of the franchise's production cycle and you have a fantastic series in the making here.  It has caught some flak for the fact of there is blood and gore dlc (all total wars have had this.... its so they can have a Teen rating on the base game) and that some factions will be added with either DLC or in the expansions to the series. There are going to be over a dozen extremely unique and completely different races in this game and the amount of work for one race is similar to one of their past games entirely, if it didn't have DLC or expansions they would have to ask over 500$ per copy... inflation sucks people we've been paying 60$ USD since the '90s",1,0,1

Well after about a year I was watching one of my favorite YouTuber's. Markiplier, play this game. And he really got in to it so i was like ok i should try this game out. So I put down the $4.99 and got the game stayed up late in the night and started the game, and just in the opening where I click new game I was alrady feeling uneasy and hearing what the guard befor you had to say was just down right shocking. So I was watching the security cameras for about one minut or so and then I put down the cameras and there was this freaking bunny right there is my face, I jumped out of my chair and was runing for that light switch, and then I came back and hade my older brother come see how scary this game was. And of corse he did it with out seeing anything or anything jumping out at him just like freaddy was taunting me. He got up told me that this game is not scary then left. So I got back on this time on night 2 where my brother left off and all hell brock loose there where things runing around this duck was standing out side of my door and every time i hit the light switch there he was just watching me. So I shut the door's and then saw that I was out of power the lights whent out the door's opened up and there was nothing. Not a sound then there he was standing there watching me, then pow! this thing is in my face im runing for the hill's and never looking back.

None of which you get to actually enjoy. Because every single time you start to do so, an Archer will simply snipe you in the back and pad their kill numbers. Or that enemy you've been battling with, slowly whittling them down? They're all covered in blood and nearly dead, and...POW! Right in the back, and another archer has stolen yet another of your kills.   And if you get close, surely the squishy archer is a dead man, right? Wrong. Then they just whip out a lightning fast, unblockable dagger and stab you to death.   This is Chivalry: Archer Avoidance, in a nutshell. Run to a fight. Get sniped by archers.

570,Dota 2,"I've played dota for eight or nine years. It is fun and worth the time and effort to learn.   Unfortunately, Dota 2 is currently maimed by an idiotic matchmaking system that punishes you for winning. That's right, punishes you. You win a few games, get over fifty percent w/l, and then all of a sudden you're getting match with guys that don't speak english and fail to understand even basic concepts of the game. Then, when you lose a ♥♥♥♥ load and your winrate is down to forty eight or forty nine percent, you're magically tossed back into a group of people that actually know what they're doing. Then you get a win streak, and get some wins and get out of the hole.   Then the cycle starts all over again. There is no way around it. No amount of always taking a carry, or always taking mid, or always waiting to pick to get what your team needs is going to help you improve your w/l rate. It is rigged, and it is frustrating.  There is also no excuse for the servers for english speaking people to always be flooded with people that don't speak english. This is not racism, this is common sense. You're playing a team based game so you need to be able to communicate with your team. It is ignorant of Valve to allow non-english speakers on the servers in such overwhelming numbers, as that it ruins the play experience for all involved. ",-1,1,0

Figured I'd come back to see the game with the series of DLC available annnd boom, to 'update' the game to what it should've been at launch I'd have to pay more than the original cost of the game for 2 more races, blood, and some generals.

So over it, 7% are sticking around for DLC I've been hearing, you deserve it, hope someone else picks up the IP and does something proper with it and Sega can go back to cutting races out of historical strategy for day 1 race DLC releases, week 2 race DLC releases and week 4 race DLC releases like they did with Attila.

Archers are limited to only 3 a team, so expect to never get to play them.  To many DLC weapons and skins. It can be real confusing when trying to tell if your opponent is on your side (several skins run about without shirts on) and you never know what the other guy is swinging at you.   The worst thing is the 'rank up' system. It tracks your skill purely by how many battles you've been in, it doesn't matter if you do well or not. After rank 15, I got it in a week, you are dumped into the same player pool with everyone rank 15 to 100, and most of them will be in the 30s or higher.  Play until you hit rank 15, after that the game loses any value of fun.  I did really like this game, and I put a bunch of time into it, but the developers have been making a lot of bad choices in it's updates since launch, and are slowly killing the game.

570,Dota 2,"I'm not a fan of MOBAs, but this has to be the worst of the lot I've played. It says something for the MOBA community when every other of the 'top rated' player reviews says something about the game's terrible community, how the game will suck the hours of your life away, or that it is supposedly filled with evil Russians (how does any of this warrant a positive review?).  Sound effects are uninspired, music is okay, character design is utterly laughable as Valve tried in vain to disguise the champions' Warcraft 3 roots, same generic MOBA gameplay like any other, washed out 'painted' landscapes soon began to hurt the eyes, same, immature and venomous community that any other MOBA has, and bizarrely lacklustre items to replace the typically imaginative skins found in other MOBAs sums up my experience.  Valve has been responsible for some brilliant releases, though this is not one of them. They appear to be making any game they know will make them a good deal of cash, the enjoyability of the product clearly no longer being an issue - the only dependent factor being that people will inexplicably buy into whatever they're given. I suppose that one positive element of DOTA 2 is that you can play as any hero for free from the very beginning. Though polished, and far from the worst game I've played, it'd be a complete waste of your life to sink any amount of hours into this game and I am genuinely saddened that it draws in 800,000-900,000 players daily according to Steam statistics.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game in its current state, is, in my opinion, one of the most watered down, shallow and simplistic Total Wars to date.  The lack of race options at launch gave the game for me, a very short lifespan, with Campaign replayablity almost non existant.  Whilst the game is aestheticall pleasing, the map is beautiful, the unit models are very nice also, but, the units themselves suffer from perhaps the biggest mistake they have made for a Warhammer title, being that they failed to put in unit officers, musicians and banners. This is simply criminal.  Back to the map, whilst it is lovely, it is way too small. You get zero sense of 'grande' in this campaign, you can basically city hop from one point to the next making the map actually feel smaller than it even is.  I do think the game will improve, but not until it is fully complete, which is going to be a number of years down the line with the additional two expansions fully added.   You cannot offer a Warhammer game, without all the races being present, and expect it to be any good. Until we can play as all races, it will never live up to its potential.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"7.00 is here, and its a blast. For sure I cannot say 100% if in the end the gameplay will be better or worse, and that because unlike some creatures of habit that feel their world come crushing down on them before even trying to learn the new changes, I will put more time into it to make a better judegement. For that reason alone no-one should take any of the hating seriously. Some people actually played 1 match in the new patch then quit. Wha? How can you know if it is better or worse like that?  All I can say is what I do like about it so far.  I like the direction of talents. They do not change a hero drastically like I feared, and got rid of the useless attributes.  UI is great, minimal and out of your face giving better vision which is always important in a competitive game and something that alays bugged me.  New map layout needs more playtime to be get a proper review from me, but so far I was able to jump into it and learn it quite fast. Shop locations are now FINALY balanced without the dire having to go to the moon for it (yeah, those few extra steps count guys), Roshan is no longer cheeply contested with dire jungle next to him and a river now surrounds him, and more jungles are added to up the importance of jngling.  The biggest changes are the shrines and the new bounty locations. This all is a step closer to PROPER jungling which was sorely lacking in this game. All it was thus far was go from camp to camp and rinse and repeat. Added bounty has also made jungling a more viable strategy, very much needed, and jungle control has now also become more important thus map control.  To compensate for some of these changes shrines add replenish locations closer to the lanes, allowing for better laning, and also a defensive strategy when need be against either ganks or bounty hunters in your jungle (no pun intended, lol).  Shrines also create for a better defence around the ancient.  Small additions like 3 slot bag and courier options are also much appreceated (you can now see who had called it before you and send it back, or alter the route of the courier, then continue its path to said player).  In general the patch is great, and it did not simplify the game neither LoL-ish it. It added much needed depth and gameplay in areas that were trully lacking. Jungling. Jungling in this game was really behind compared to other moba titles in the compatition.  And for all those saying why would they make it like LoL. They didn't, they are adding improvements most moba games already have. You don't evolve wih the genre you die out, simple, and there were elements in Dota2 that were lacking.  Given time, I can bet most of the haters will love the new patch. Except for the pretentious ones that are stuck in the notion that this is becoming like LoL and feel this is a bad thing.  Neither is true. Dota 2 is still dota 2. Adding elements increases depth, nothing was taken away, and the pace of the game was greatly improved. The layers to new strategy have now become a lot more, and people are simply frantically rushing about trying to learn it hence not happy about old tricks not working.  That is called a habit. Competitve games can do without that tyvm.  Definately recommend this title, still to this day.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"It is difficult to recommend this game presently. When it works, it is enjoyable like so many other entries in the Total War series. However, I have encountered a game-breaking bug that has effectively prevented me from making ANY progress in campaigns beyond a certain point (normally around turn 70-90) in two of my three campaigns so far. Basically, the game decides to spawn the Chaos armies in a scripted event around turn 70-90, but if you're unlucky like me and so many other players, Chaos won't spawn and your game becomes bugged. At this point, you cannot end turn or move your units around the map. Nothing will fix the issue short of starting a new campaign, and seemingly there's nothing you can do to prevent it from happening, either. Thus, if and when the bug occurs, your campaign is borked and you've lost 10-15 hours of play. Given the hundreds of posts on the issue over the past month at the CA forums, Reddit, and the Steam group, I find it inexcusable for a company to let a bug of this magnitude slip and go unacknowledged until yesterday.  CA says they are 'looking into' this bug. However, if the fix doesn't retroactively apply to older campaigns, I'm done with this game and any future CA titles.

Since this patch most of the changes and added stuff are just turning the game into LOL. This is not the real Dota atmosphere. There are too many OP stuff nowadays and they even keep adding new more OP stuff to the game. In conlcusion I would say that they spent too much money into commercialising the game and bringing new players to it. I lost all my interest in the game since the main goal is attracting more players to the game and most of all attracting people who will WATCH the game. Before that Dota was really a unique game, now it's a mash between LoL Hos and Smite. Dota lost it's identity and this for a game is the worst thing to happen. I guess money are more important nowadays than tradition which even makes me sad. Valve's point is creating people who WATCH the game and I don't want to be a part of such community.

Two big reasons:  One: Items.  Most items are very useful and easy to use, but simply don't offer enough in terms of defense against stacked characters. No matter the items, if you are versing a Lion who is decent enough, he will kill you unless you or others kill him first.  Two: The biggest one, YOU ARE PUNISHED FOR SUCKING NO MATTER YOUR SKILL LEVEL Yeah, this might seem weird, you would want people to be punished for doing bad, but apparantly to Valve missing out on XP and possible kills isn't bad enough. So they thought about how else could they punish someone who is sucking, no matter if they legitimately don't know what they are doing or if they just are having a bad game, and it struck them: Let's have them lose gold. Yeah, if you are having a bad game, you will never come back from it because you'll never have the gold to get the items to help you. It's a simply screwed system that can't be fixed.

If you're thinking that this game has realistic combat you obviously didn't play it. Chivalry Medieval Warfare is a game that makes you wanna smash your PC with a 2-handed hammer (with nice skin for 5 $) and then throw it out of the window.   I bought this game on sale and i thought I'd get realistic combat. What I actually got was a bunch of knights making crazy-♥♥♥ tricks with swords, archers with daggers faster than light ( spam2win), and dudes killing you with their bare fists. No joking. In this game a knight with full-set plate armor can be fisted (you could expect this joke) to death. Also if you're thinking that archer can't parry/block a massive 2-handed warhammer that in reality could smash through a brick wall, your computer and your first born son you're right. It can't. In reality. In this game it's actually possible.  But it doesn't matter that this game is awful. It's not bad and can be very enjoyable if you can hold on your nerves. If it's not the realism you're looking for you'll probably like it. I, unfortunately, bought this game hoping I'd get realism. And although I enjoyed playing it I can't really recommend it.

Basically, you run, you shout, you chop people's limbs off in the most satisfying way imaginable, and you get good, and then you chop even more limbs off plus smash some heads in with a giant hammer (that stuff never gets old). Do some objectives, come hither, oooo look: a rainbow!, run some more, duel, duel on TO servers, get scolded for duelling on TO servers, go on a duel server, get rekt, go back to TO and behave! Rinse and repeat. Fun, fun, fun!  It's like being inside The Kingdom of Heaven (the film, not the actual place) with all its visceral beauty and gore. It will get your heart racing and you'll feel every slash, every bash and every stab. Decent headphones are a must - there is no sound more awe-inspiring than that of someone's helmet, skull and brains being mushed into a sticky pulp with one drop of a maul. It's just beautiful!  Stick around and you'll meet some of the nicest people around (at least EU-side, but I do have friends in the States too). Community-driven events and antics happen all the time and you can count on veteran players helpin you out with tactics, optimisation and anything really. Sure, there are a few bell-ends too, but every game has a few, nothing to be concerned about. Talk to me if you need anything and I'm sure 99% of players over 50 lvl will say the same.  In terms of graphics - little bit outdated, but it's UE3 so there's no surprise. Sound design is superb, rivalled only by that of Alien: Isolation and I'm not saying it lightly. Playability?

Basically, knights and archers are the only two classes with function; the others are just fodder. --Did I mention knights are over-powered? The knight class can one-hit anything and take what seems to be hundreds of hits to kill. --You have to pay even more to use decent weapons, plus features of the game are actually LOCKED after you paid way too much money for what the game is.

The controls are god awful. Really really really terrible. I cant currently think of a game I have played that controls worse than this actually.  Why were attacks bound to the ♥♥♥♥ing mouse wheel? You realize there are about 1000 keys on a keyboard right? What is V dodge and only one class can dodge? Why is there a ♥♥♥♥ing progression system that locks most of the weapons so youll have to grind levels over and over? What the hell is with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit boxes?  Archers are hands down my favorite class in video games. Failing that a rogue or a mage come in close second. Its painful to play an archer in this game. They take about 10 years to notch an arrow and the trajectory seems off to me. As if the arrow follows a random path every time you fire.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Left my positive review up for a long time, in honour of all the fun this game once gave me - but I recently uninstalled it, because ♥♥♥♥ it. High-level play is simply not fun - it's based around mechanics exploits. Some will argue whether they are 'exploits' and that's fine - but the fact remains they are NO FUN. Even when the servers seem well-balanced, 99% of team objective games involve one side completely stomping the other. It's vaguely kind of enjoyable when you are the stomper the first few times, but eventually anyone who actually enjoys gaming will long for the rare *close* matches, whether they win or lose them. Once in a blue moon, you really do get a magnificent match - two skilled teams grinding away at each other, neither one utterly dominated by spinners and clanfolk, slowly giving and losing ground, until it comes down to a frantic 1-minute count on the final objective -- and when that happens, it honestly doesn't matter who wins, the game is so much fun for everyone. But those games have gotten rarer and rarer and rarer as the community has gotten worse and worse and worse (and 'better' - in the sense of racking up cheap kills that preclude any of the interesting mid-battle duels that used to happen), and now it's just not worth it anymore.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"To describe this game in just a few words: immersive and impressive yet anti-climactic. For me, it provides no closure or sense of accomplishment -- there's no way to win in this game, and that makes it feel empty. Taking over territory has no direction besides gaining certification points, which are used to buy upgrades (so you can get more certification points?). By definition, you can't really call this a game -- it's more of a combat sandbox and social experiment. If that's what you want, go for it.  It's only really fun when you have several hours to play at a time during an alert with a platoon with leadership that communicates and strategizes. Otherwise, you're stuck wandering around trying to find a fight that is evenly matched. Nobody wants to just sit there and get spawn camped when you could be somewhere else getting more cert points.   The scale of this game is incredible, but the payoff just isn't there. If you feel like you're winning, it's rarely because of something you did, and it feels like you're just in the right place at the right time.

Every 4 turns withut fail your so called 'legendary lords' will be assainated...or wounded as the game puts it only to be rehired put back into play and BAM lvl 1 enemy agent wipes them out again..this may seem exaggerated and really i wish it was.

Nope not even the close...50% percent of the time you will critically fail, 35% of the time you will just fail, the rest you will see marginal results at best. in 63 hours ive never seen my agents accomplish an assasination....not evern once.  2.

I must say Creative Assembly did a pretty good job for their first forray into fantasy. The map is well constructed, though I wish you could occupy settlments from other races, and gives each area a distinctive look.The units are varied between races, with dwarves having axes, gyrocopters and artillery, and the chaos using the fallen and hellish creations such as the dragon ogres. Despite it only being a few days after release the game also runs pretty well, I run it on a mix between ultra and high, mainly putting shadows on high, with a i5 4590 and gtx 970 and the game run above 30fps even in large fights.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Although I am fairly new to steam, I have put thousands of hours into this game. This is my favourite game. It is an rpg with fps qualities, taking place in the post apocalyptic US. It has prewar qualities as well as futuristic weaponry which in my opinion is a beautiful and memorable mix. Survival, mutations, storyline, and an open map to explore. Out of the DLCs Point Lookout in my opinion is the best, 'Walking with Spirits' is an amazing quest, and the swampfolk I found made interesting enemies. The Pitt is good as well, with new mutations and weaponry; and you can go back afterwards which is important to me. I wasn't very fond of the other two, but they were still worth doing. Mothership Zeta for me is mainly collecting items and putting them into an area of the ship that doesn't close off after completion.   Anyways there is some controversy over if it should be called Fallout 3 or if New Vegas should be the third installment, what I have to say to that is they are both great games. I enjoy all of the Fallout games though (all 6) and don't feel the need to rank them. Afterall, the worst Fallout game in the series to me still is better than most other games. Most of the games old-new have wildly varying gameplay, but all that to the side, the story, the setting, and their unique mix of prewar qualities, futuristic tech, and mutations makes the Fallout series my favourite. So do I recommend this game? Hell yes I do.",1,0,1

But, the game becomes significantly better once you find a group of people who enjoy the game and want to support you, not only in the game, but as a team member.  What I’m trying to get at is, find some friends to play with you, find a Dota group, add players who are nice at the game and party with them and if they're enjoyable to play with, keep playing with them; regardless of the team side.  I joined a group, named “The Art of Warfare” TAW for short, and ever since I’ve had so much more fun. The group is supportive and very kind. And knowing most of the people who read these reviews, you're sick of the game's community and you want to discuss it, or even out of curiosity of the subject of the reviews.  If you're interested, you can send me a friend request and I can set you up for some of the 'In-house matches' and see if you want to join TAW. Matches are Thursdays and Sundays at 6:00 pm PST.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I dont play (ok, played) this on my PC but on my Tablet.. I thought I write my warning here..  The game is a time waster.. very good one.. and became with the last update even MORE time waster. Let me explain. The game is a resource game.. running in real time. You can play it clicking your ♥♥♥ off, play it idle and do nothing at all beside a few clicks every here and then.. or a mix of both.  I played a mix, as sometimes I want to click a bit and other times I prefer to sleep! :p So for 5 days I wasted my time.. and I felt very sorry for myself during game time.. why am I wasting my life with this? Anyhow.. got myself a little setup and reached Lv400 in 50min on my farm run for hero souls. Got about 350 on average on a run. Skilled mainly chance to spawn a Primal Boss and Hero Souls drop amount plus more gold in IDLE mode. I was happy wasting my time... and the update came.. no question, do you want to upgrade? Just suddenly I got way more Hero Souls.. niiiice, what a lucky run.. when I hit over 1k Souls.. I started to understand, something goes different as usual. Bed time.. started game again next day and screen pops up.. Transcence bla bla.. Help Screen to explain it all.. like a lerner driver gets this instruction: Open Door of the car, start car, drive as it is demanded by law, park and exit car. So.. basicly nada! Next I start my run.. why are my heroes not guilded anymore?? Why does all take soooooooo much longer? To make it short.. that is what r2games sold you. We made a upgrade and BALANCED the game. How unbalanced it was before.. example: My next upgrade for chance to get a primal boss was 72 Hero Souls... after the update +86k Hero souls.. so the developper thought it needed a balance to a skill that was 1 : 1200 out of balance. Yes, but we gave you more Hero Soul income too... true.. went from 400 average to 1500 on a run.. lets say 4 time more... to 1200 more cost.. my same farm run of 50min is now over 3 hours... and instead of beeing able to upgrade my chance for hero boss 3 times on one farm run to 400.. I would need over 50 runs for 1 upgrade. So wasting time is one thing, this is just simply super stupid.. I guess to many people came to the end of 'get arthritis when you are old game'.. and instead of putting some brain into it.. they just made everything a s h i t l o a d take more time.  So all in short: If you want to kill your last brain cells with boredom, if you cant understand or play games, which demands at least an IQ of 90.. this is your game and you will LOVE it!!! In any other case.. do yourself a favor, man... drill yourself a hole in your head.. makes more sense than playing this game for brain dead idiots. This is THE game for street cleaners, garbage men and bums living under the bridge.. about the IQ you need to play this junk and think this is a great game..",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,Alright First of all. Great game. The combat felt ballanced and consistant. you make stupid choises and you eat alot of bullets and choke on them. You have an action hero's resistance to bullets... More than most people should beable to take but you take too much and you die and there is suprisingly very little forgiving situations. The game had a bunch of good rather grim and gritty humor and a bunch of other just little things that I apreciated. Not perfect but I say it is solid.  HOWEVER.... Do NOT get this game on steam. Get off your lazy rump and go pick it up for a console... or chance it. up to you. Farcry and aparently other Ubisoft games require an extra program to be downloaded and then... wow read their User Agreement Licence. If their program causes your computer to catch on fire and it was Directly their fault... it is NOT their fault and screw you fix your own computer. I Dont like having extra program things that launch my games. Thats steam... i dont need a second steam for ONE game nor do I apreciate there being a second layer for failure incase the internet or servers go down. Fairly sure Both programs must be in working order and Im very VERY sure that the UPlay program does not have an offline mode... least thats the fear anyway.

So all those lucky people who have nothing but hours on end to invest in playing video games can play with their own kind, and the rest of us can get some enjoyment out of the same game playing with other casual gamers... In short... unless you are going to commit yourself to a life of playing chivalry... don't buy this game, because you will hate it the second you are no longer eligible to be in a beginner server.

As for the gameplay, while not feeling fundamentaly good, the shooting is fine, the special abilities felt like a last minute add-on just because every single other games are doing it too, also the AI felt really stupid.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"The game not only allows hours of endless fun but has a unique way of presenting to it as well. At first you arrive on a continent on a world and you can deploy anywhere and od course people want to head where the action is and in fact the game gives a way where it senses where the most termoil is. Next the combat is sureal because there is always a problem wheter it is in enemy lines or all the way deep in friendly territory. Because the game is multiplayer there is always a complication because of course some people just find a way in. The only negative effect in the game i could find is it needs a way to allow for more customization i mean after a while fighting as the same person gets boring right? i wish they would lower the prices to buy the equipment not only will it mean players can customize the character more but people will flock to get teh game because of all these awesome features, the graphics are amazing and best part is each continent is a giant map and there are no loading screens just log in and play that is all that is required",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Worst game I have ever played.   To start the game is severely broken. Like glitches, bugs, exploits run ravage through the game although the developers clearly have no interest in fixing any issues. In the eyes of torn banner this is a dead game, you are much better off buying a game with a dedicated team because you DEFINITELY wont find it here.   Not to mention the lack of any new content, unless you like paying outragious prices for weapon and armour skins. The game is severely broken and I'd reccommend buying a bottle of vodka instead because you will have much more fun drinking it than playing this.   There is no such thing as a community, everyone hates each other and will instantly kick you from a game if your ping is above 90. YES that's right, you will be kicked for the stupidest of reasons no matter what. Also the game is so unfairly balanced any new players will kick themselves out of frustration for buying it.   In conclusion, this is a dead game with horrible developers who have no interest in futhering the game, let alone fixing it. The community is toxic and incredibly harsh on newer players. I bought this game in the steam sale and believe me, it wasn't cheap enough then so don't pay full price. You're a sap if you do. Buy a better game like cs go, rust, arc, mount &amp; blade.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"The interface: It's clunky. Important Icons are scattered all over the place. On some dialogs the dismissal button is a checkmark in the middle of the dialog, other times it's on the bottom right. You have menus that jump up from buttons, but look just like buttons, menus that disappear before you have a chance to click the option you want  The AI: The AI is essentially like playing turn based chess. It will choose the softest spot to hit you every time. It knows everything you do. So if you start a siege half way across the map with your main force, don't be surprised when 10 different faction armies suddenly make their way through the fog of war and come take half of your territory. It's really irritating when your allies then come retake the stuff you lost and you have to declare war on your allies to get your territories back.  Cut Scenes: The cut scenes were actually pretty decent  The Tutorial / Intro: It wasn't super bad, but the interface and how everything is laid out made it hard to follow.   General issues: There's this really annoying issue where if you have a Hero (not to be confused with the Leader of your Army) merge in with your army it will somehow always be selected by itself at the beginning of the turn and you'll think you're moving your army when in reality you end up removing your Hero away from the army. The AI will absolutely do everything it can to slay the Hero whom is now all by itself because its movement is higher than the Army and you won't be able to remerge them until next turn. So I spent a lot of time clicking off my army, or pressing escape, and then re-selecting my army to move it.  I played multiple games on Normal, the AI is rediculous. It will move just out of reach every turn. It will exploit every mistake or mistep you make with surgical precision. The only variability, or chance you might survive such a brutal, relentless AI, appears to be in the way it determines winners within battles.   Somehow the AI players get to obliterate your hero even if you lose a battle and are retreated a few spaces away. It seemed like every time I lost a major fight with my main force my hero dies, whereas when they lost a major battle with their main force their hero always had a chance to flee far, far, away.  Otherwise, it's just battle chess with better graphics and units. I would wait for the price to come down before purchasing this game, it's definitely not worth $59.99.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: Warhammer Review (Short and Sweet)  This game is very fun. It is my favorite Total War game to date. The combat visuals look great and are very entertaining. I find myself getting distracted often during battles because I like to watch them fight. The campaign needs some fine tuning, and there are quite a few mods out now that can make that experience a lot better. The maps are well done, I wouldn\'t say they\'re great, and there needs to be a little more added IMO. However, I can\'t complain because the combat is fun. Each faction is unique in their own rights. Learn how to use them efficiently and your gameplay experience will be much better. Online multiplayer has been a blast so far. Everyone is friendly and most of the time communication is not a problem. I would recommend this game for anyone that enjoys the Total War series.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"So, let me open this by saying that i am a huge Warhammer fan. TW:WH is a great game, especially because of the awesome mod support. TW:WH is also pretty acceptable lorewise, as much as possible without comprimising the 'fun' part. Now the problems though: This game has not nearly as many factions to play as other Total Wars. And every new DLC costs loads of money. This is redeemed in my eyes by the work that has gone into each faction. In contrast to other Total Wars, every faction is very unique. Also, hopefully at the end there will be the whole Warhammer Fantasy world (which is massive).   To put this all together: This game is great and expansive, expect to get around 30 hours out of every 15 $ DLC and ~100 hours out of the base game if you like either Total War or Warhammer.",1,0,1

265930,Goat Simulator,"This game has honestly changed my life. I used to dream about goating as a child, but was always scared to come out and say it. What would people think? What would they say? For countless years, I was in bondage to this fear. Whenever friends of mine would mention goats, I had to remove myself from the conversation for fear that my goating desires would become evident.   BUT THEN CAME GOAT SIMULATOR.  When I first saw Goat Simulator, my heart began beating faster than a goat with a jetpack. Could it be? Could all of my built-up anxiety from supressing my goating desires finally have an outlet? With a shaky index finger, I pre-ordered the game and waited for the release. After all of this time, I was so close to finding fulfillment! But I was nervous. Nervous that my fragile hopes might be once again dashed upon the rocks of despair and misery. But my worrying was for naught. Goat Simulator is everything I ever dreamed of, and more. I know there are many people out there that are afraid, like I was, of sharing their goating desire with the world. Goat Simulator has given me the courage to do just that, and I hope and pray it will do the same for you.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"This game is pure Pay-To-Win garbage hidden as a MMOFPS.   First off, it runs like ♥♥♥. It manages to peak at 45 FPS, but I rarely ever seen anything above 10 FPS even on the lowest setting. And it's not even because it has great graphics or anything, it looks like an early Playstation 3 game. It just isn't a good game on the software part.  Second, I've played for a total of three hours, and I have managed to get 5 kills, because my guns are peashooters and my armor is swiss cheese compared to what everyone else wears. I have emptied an entire clip into a Heavy, in the back, and he lived to kill me while I reloaded. And you don't win that important currency you need to win better weapons, because you don't get kills.   Also, the 'massive fights' are about as impressive as 32 players on Halo 3. Yes, there are alot of people around, no, it doesn't mean you'll get the impression you're fighting a massive fight, because everyone wears the same armor and looks exactly the same, so there's a massive chance you'll have the impression there's only 16 people in the fight. Hell, there's a massive chance you won't know what you're fighting because only 2 classes have different armor, the Max and the Heavy, who just looks like he has football gear on.  The team balance is just fantastic in this game. I made the error of picking the Red Faction, and I have not seen us win a single battle, because the game doesn't seem to limit the amount of enemy soldiers we fight, or balance the gear out, so we can be five people dropping from an APC against 7 people riding around in jets.  Oh, and vehicules are just peachy. Basically, if you are in a plane, no one on the ground can touch you. If you are in a tank, no infantry can touch you. If you have alot of tanks, no one can touch you because you can just break every tank they try to spawn, and they can't do ♥♥♥♥ because infantry cannot do a single thing against tanks. I mean, sure, they can shoot a rocket launcher at you, but it barely dents the armor and then you one shot them and jump out to repair it instantly  The level design is not thought out at all, and they just mash premade buildings together to give a point of interest. I have ran through the same building in every single fight I've been in. It's not like I'd notice because the visual design is so bland everything looks the same even when they're not using premade buildings. If it's a point of interest, you can be sure it's an Halo map defended by clones of Commander Sheperd.  Update: I have played the game for 12 hours now. The planes are ♥♥♥♥ing unflyable. Still have not gotten into a tank, because I'm either in a fight where we can't use tanks due to the map's lack of design or in a fight where the tank terminal was broken by an enemy tank.   I've tried the MAX suit. That was fun for about 15 seconds, until I got instakilled by rockets/C-4/anything explosive. It's really good game design to make a suit that costs as many ressources as a tank, but has half the firepower or half the armor of a Heavy. It does make you slightly immune to bullet, which doesn't matter because headshots still seem to bypass armor. And you can't get healed by medics, so you have to hope anyone plays the worthless Engineer class just to heal you.   The Infiltrator's snipers do no damage, because for some reason, damage falloff applies to snipers. The cloak is also very ♥♥♥♥, it lets you be invisible if you sit completely still, for a very limited amount of time, so you can't use it in any useful situations.  The jetpack guy is decent, apart from the fact that you can't jetpack and aim at stuff, otherwise it's an engineer that can fly. I guess the only way to use it is to drop C-4 on people from high altitude, but I can't afford C-4 because this game is unplayable.  You have no reason to play engineer, unless you're gonna drive a tank or there's an abundance of MAX on the field.  Still have not earned enough certs to buy ANYTHING, so I guess that guy lied, you can't buy everything you need in 20 hours.  The controls are still ♥♥♥. There's no getting used to it, it's ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable, no one in their right mind would be able to play this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  Rocket launchers are worthless, the hitbox on the rocket is so terrible, it'll go through your target most of the time.",-1,1,0

Leavers/AFKers/Quiters run rampant. I mean seriously, how is it possible not to have a decent report system in 2015 that can handle these players.  My advice, if you are a true fan of Dota, just play the original warcraft 3 custom map. Either that or move to LoL/HoN/Smite. This game is a disgrace...really shame",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"The game is good, strong early game with hero units and magic. However, a lot of it is still just a reskin of the last game. I enjoy the game, but I still feel like they did not put as much effort into it as they have in past titles. This game will obviously get better reviews over Rome II and Attilla the Hun because nerd boy fan base for warhammer, which it does deserve, its not good enough to beat previous titles such as medieval, Rome, or the last Shogun. Still, with that being said, I\'m sure there will be some mods to adjust the game into a much better title, but I review based off the core game. Now to give the game a few scores based on 1-10 scale.  Graphics 7 : Its good, but nothing to write home about. It is better optimized for its graphics though, which is great!  Sound 7 : Nothing too special here. Music is good, but you can always pick your own music and enjoy that more.  Gameplay 8 : Good battles, interesting armies, hero units, and spells. Good combination of stuff to enjoy when doing a battle, and enough to make you want to try each faction. Hero units have increased replay value tremendously. You also gear up your hero units with quests and objectives, so you get the 'grind for gear' feel that most of us gamers chase. Such a great add on to the game.  Maps 4 : Really the most disappointing part of this game is the lack of good maps. People may or may not agree, but I feel as though this is by far the laziest part of the game. It is almost enough to ruin the game after a while. The only map that gives a vast difference are 'siege' maps which you don't get to do very often unless you are the attacker since the AI straight up won\'t follow through on a siege. 55 hours into the game, and the AI has only attacked one of my castles once. I'll increase difficulty to see if that changes anything and edit my review.  AI 6.5 : You can read my previous statement about them not attacking my castles to see why I'm bitter. Some of the other issues are minor combat issues. Nothing too bad, but not enough issues to make this a riding the line score. And before you say \'mods will fix this\' I am a firm believer that mods should enhance a game, not fix it.  Anyway, I'm sure there are other things I can score and judge, but you have all the important information. I recommend this game, but be warned its not the best title they have. I apologize if my spelling is off in advance.  UPDATED REVIEW Some more updated info, if you are curious about some of the changes that really change gameplay.  1. Towers on your base now reach the entire length of the map and do pretty high damage. So, if you are one of the players that enjoy actually sitting there and lobbing stuff at a base for a while from a catapult, you no longer can do that (there are mods to fix this since its a common annoyance for players)  2. Combat is pretty quick. Morale is a bit odd, at times it doesn't even make sense. Also I think that they are having issues with the undead 'fear' mechanic, because it really doesn't seem to do anything right now. Could be wrong.  3. Questing for gear is a thing. Its great, I love it.  4. Success chance one assassin to kill another is based on the difference in level, and it makes a VERY large difference. If you get unlucky and don't get one early and level it, it gets so bad sometimes that you have to restart the game. (I feel especially when its between greenskins and dwarves.)  5. Your assassins aren't just reskinned clones of each other. Each of them have very useful talents and abilities.  EDIT REVIEW:  I had a thumbs up, even with all the issues I mentioned. The new problem for me is the DLC policy. I'll never buy a total war game again. Company doesn't deserve to be in business when it puts out crap DLC at high prices. I don't play the sims for that very reason, and someone should make some type of 'mock company' to do legal cloning of these games and put them out with reasonable dlcs. That person would get rich pretty quick. I am tempted to try to hire people to do it for me after I find out what the laws are on that type of thing. Anyway, don't waste your money, move along.

You are no longer classed as a 'Low rank' anymore andhave to play with anyone level 16 onwards, this goes up to atleast thelevels 50's. The thing is yes they are betetr skilled players, but these players also use gamebreaking glitches such as moves where you hit twice in one swing and crouch and just do inhumane movements in order to kill you. I know its a game but this total ruins the realism, It just doesnt feel playable when people are killing you for kills that dont even exist, its like why should I play. Also another problem is that the servers do not seem to be as supported from level 15 onwards and are not official anymore, thereforethe hosts etc are laggier, making the game solid to play, I have people stab me from large distances just because the game does not feel catered for and I lag in most game, and I have good interent speeds and a really good computer. But generally it is just annoying all those people who spend so many horus in this game are are good but nothing to compete with doing all these stupid moves.

The game has it merits--but at best it's a idling game and something to do for a quick 5 mintues. Also the ingame microtransactions can get costly, so this is how the developers earn their money.

One hilarious example I have is how a veteran player with a RPG killed me at long distance. I took the initial shot: a sniper shot to center mass. The shot hit but didn't seem to even phase the opponent. A few seconds later I was an exploded mess of charred flesh and kevlar.  It must be a fantastic experience for people who have poured 100+ hours into this game. For everyone else it is a sea of disappointment and frustration.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I played 23 hours so far. It's a fairly generous 8/10 for me.  Good looking game, and some sights are gorgeous. Having said that, this is like far Cry2 in Far Cry (1) settings. It's a go get, do this, mission quest. Unlike far Cry which was about mercs and a crazy scientific experiment.   That does make Far Cry 3 a bit of a grind, albeit a good grind. I don't see myself doing much after the main quest is over. I mean I can't see me collecting every loot chest, relic, lost-letter, etc. There is no point to it really, so that part's just a grind, because there's hundreds of them.  Liberating outposts is better than expected. Getting in and cutting off the alarm before the pirates signal help is rewarding. Plus you get extra exp for doing it without an alarm going off. Another place where it excels is missions in the main quest take you to amazing places. The sets they send you to are a bit Tomb Raider style, without the puzzles. All the up-sides then.  It is addictive. I liberate one outpost and think I'll just do another, and another. Then I might finish with a main quest mission. Then another outpost, including hunter mini-quests gained at the outpost.  If it was just a hint more Far Cry (1), I would rate it higher. Also, why oh why didn't they put an inventory/progress quick-save key on. We can go to the main menu and save progress/inventory. It's diabolical they didn't give us a hotkey.",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"This is one of those games where you play it for two hours, think it's alright, and then come back to it a year later. Which is  exactly  what I did. But when I returned and got farther into the story, I have to admit that I became really impressed with the game and questioned why I left it for so long. While the main characters are very cliche, I feel that this adds to the reality that these are regular every-day people stuck on this island. Meanwhile there are very unique characters, such as Sam, Hoyt, Buck, Citra, and the  oddly attractive  psychopath Vaas. This contrast serves to make very interesting relationships between the characters, which of course adds to the story. Now in the beginning, the game was actually pretty boring to me, hence why I left it after not feeling very captivated, but it honestly picked up quickly after that and soon I was sucked in (and on my second playthrough I really had a better appreciation for the beginning, so maybe you'd like it better than I did). Through the game, as I improved new abilities I was discovering such as paragliding, boating, racing, looting, challenges, completing bounties, capturing camps, crafting, collecting, exploring, hunting, and my all-time favorite, poker, I became more and more comfortable with the environment, to the extent of being completely satisfied with everything the game offers. But legit guys, the poker in this game is pretty immersive. Besides all of that though, I enjoy the soundtrack and especially the game's main theme (though Make It Bun' Dem is definitely up there). The moods of each song echo the feeling of the game in that moment or mission, and I can really appreciate that in all games. Now onto general gameplay, it's solid. I don't see any problems with the fps aspects, and I find driving extremely fun with the realism of it, having your camera angle in a place that makes it feel as if you are actually driving (it's more on the side and not centered). And while events in the game may not always be realistic, specific story elements are always there to back it up, with the plot constantly improving as the game progresses (though there  is  a point where it slows down a bit, but it's a spoiler so I can't say~).  All in all, I definitely recommend this game. It has to be one of my favorites, and I'm still going back to it every now and then just to hunt, drive, and kick Tyrone's ♥♥♥ in poker.",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is my first Far Cry game and I didn't like it. Maybe it is due to my higher standards after playing mostly games like Skyrim, FallOut New Vegas or Oblivion.  The good thing about this game is that you can just drive around and take over bases. The bad thing is, that the game is too much like a big playground. Icons on the map lead to minigames and missions only start once you went to a special spot. The storyline is very linear and often stupid. Especially the ending of the game makes barely sense. There was almost no immersion when I played the game. Jason Brody was such a wimp... I didn't like him as character. Especially his feminine voice. In the end I had quite some fun with the game, but it ended way to easily.  Reasons why I don't like this game: - No immersion - People look pretty much all the same - Bad AI - You have to kill animals to build bags and in missions you (for example) have to hunt a bunch of dogs with a flamethrower. That's f##ed up. - The pirates don't make counter attacks, so once you conquered all bases you're out of work. - Stupid plot twists. - No realism or depths. - Short playing time. - Invisible walls to keep the player on track.",-1,0,0

Bugs presented as fun feature in this game are found in almost every game - accompanied by an actual fun gameplay experience.  Also I experienced strong motion sickness within an hour.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"good game overall, big total war fan since I was 11 and now 20, not really a fan of the more streamlined city and building chains, much preferred something more like medieval 2 but i suppose streamlined games seem to appeal to a wider audince? in any case, yer its a good game overall maybe best game for total war since shogun (personally wasn't too fussed about Atilla and very unimpressed with rome 2) but the same problem that has been creeping up over and over in the last few years is the DLC, i already spent £40 on this game and i'm expected to pay the same for what 3 extra factions and some extra units? very unfair in my ideas and sole reason for a negative review as how can i enjoy the game knowing it's incomplete despite the fact i've already payed as much as i have",-1,0,0
220240,Far Cry® 3,"I was excited to play FarCry3 at this time, with FarCry4 coming out soon. I jumped at the sale price. I liked what I saw of the reviews and playthroughs. 'It's a must have', right?  But I have played only a few hours and am about to give up, because I already played TOMB RAIDER and loved it.  Yeah, this game is like TR quite a bit. You visited an island that you shouldn't have. You were captured. You now have to survive and escape. Become the warrior. Bow and arrow, hunt for supplies, upgrade weapons, jumping puzzles and platforming (yes FarCry3 has platforming!) Even running out of burning buildings, searching for relics at shrines, stealth kills, limited ammo, zip lines, radio towers, alarms you have to disable, the ability to purchase map pieces to reveal locations of rare items, wildernessd skill progression, combat skill progression, unlockable takedown skills....  I mean it's a TR knockoff in every way. It's even set in the south china sea, on an island which has it's own flavor of asia-pacific culture and mysticism. There are WWII coastal defense cannons scatered about the map, but they don't look nearly as cool or as genuine as the beautifully rendered, imposing, crusty old cannons in creepy bunkers famed in TR. THOSE are coastal defense cannons. So with all of these cheap imitations, I feel FC3 is not it's own game.  These are story-driven games. FPS + RPG is a great genre, which started with Mass Effect (as far as I know) but they have to have a story leading the player through the game to the end. FC3, in my opinion, has a basic premise, not a story. The premise is that your friends were captured and you have to save them. That's it. No disaster to avoid, no cataclysm to stop, no reason to be afraid to continue for the weight of the story bearing down on your fragile character. Just go and kill people, because you're invincible. No death, no impending doom, no story. There is fun. But there's no fear; if I could compare ME and TR to FC3, that would be what's missing. Being scared. Not knowing what was going to happen next. No insurmountable odds to overcome at the end of the story, thus making you and your character true heroes in the process. Just: become the warrior and strealthkill everyone on the map with ease in normal mode. Le sigh.  TR had bullet-time close quarters combat, which is truly awesome, now that I find it missing from FC3. When an animal lunges at you in FC3, he just eats your face, and you have to mash some random button in order to survive (sometimes it's E which is 'use', sometimes it's spacebar which is jump, but it hasn't been F yet, which would make sense since it's the melee key), then you heal up and you're OK. Or, he eats your face and you respawn, and you're OK. Sometimes you die before the key indicator shows on screen... so it feels like it doesn't matter what key you press. In TR, it mattered which key, and when. It was the melee key, as I recall, and it was all done in slow-mo, because once that animal had his teeth in you it was game over. Damn that was cool.  The only real improvement over TR is that the open world is explorable. You can jump in a car and drive anywhere. So if you didn't like TR's one-path map, then you will like FC3's big, open world.  Another thing: FC3 instantly reminded me of 'Watch_Dogs' when I got in a car. Same engine, same mechanics. Ubisoft, I love you. Open world RPG FPS. Really. I just need more story because I'm spoiled by TR and ME. :D  Honestly there's not much replayability in FC3 or TR, unlike ME where you could choose another class with a new skillset, or another choice of dialog options which gave you a different ending ala 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books. So why did I play TR through a second time? There's nothing I can do differently, except find all the hidden stuff on the map. I guess it was so good that I wanted to do it again.  Sad news: from preliminary reviews and previews of FC4, it sounds to be just like FC3 with a couple new skills and mechanics. Same thing, different place, different characters and story. God, I hope it has a story.  So, If you've played TR and liked it, like I did, then you might want to skip FarCry3 and FarCry4, unless you really want more of the same in an open world, instead of a narrow path.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game looks good, which you'd expect. It has some nice new innovations, like being about to travel through mountains if you're a dwarf or orc. You get 4 races (yes, just 4) but there is more variation in those races than you usually get in Total War titles.  You will complete it with all 4 races very quickly, then you'll realise that the game does not have any depth, the tech-trees are extremely limited and the late game is tedious . Also this is very much a re-skinning of teh total war engine, which is creaking a little bit at this stage.  The icing on the cake is that Creative Assembly have decided to release DLC at outrageous prices, so getting the full game could cost you way over €100. On the whole a good game but extremely light on content because they've broken the game down into tiny chunks to extract the money from players.",-1,1,0

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Yes, I know, as of posting this review I haven't played very much at all, however I have my reasons. This game is actually scary for me. Too scary, in fact. I tried twice to get past the first phone call and I couldn't bring myself to do it because these animatronics are the embodiement of my worst fears. The fact that I can't even run or hide from them is also part of the over-all fear. Even though the scares are jumpscares (and I really hate jumpscares because they give me too much of a scare all at once) the build up to them is enough to scare anyone or at least make them tense.  I know it all sounds like a negative review so far, but allow me to explain why I actually recommend this game. It's not the fan base which we all know has its problems (but so does every fandom and subculture ever), nor is it the game play or the graphics or any of that stuff, but it is in fact the lore of these games that keeps my interest. I love the story of it all. In this first game, most of the story is completely hidden, but when you look at it, this restaurant and these animatronics are part of a much bigger story, one of sorrow, murder, deception, haunting, possession, grudges, revenge, and a yearning for freedom. (sorry if that's not spelled correctly) There is seriously a heck ton more to this game than what you see on the surface. I won't spoil any of the story for you. Look into it yourself and you'll be in for one of the most interesting and complex stories in the horror section that we've seen in a while.  There is a reason for everything. Remember that when looking at this game.",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,"Unrewarding and toxic game if you play by yourself. Community is so bad that it is impossible to solo queue without having to wish the apocalypse had hit humanity sooner. Since the game is heavily team orientated, you are basically relying on potatoes to carry since none of them want to or have the right amount of brain cells to play support. This leads to uncoordinated disastrous 'team' fights and you will end up losing the game unless you were lucky enough to be teamed up with decent human beings.    Without taking the community into account, the game is challenging and enjoyable if you play with a 5 stack; otherwise you would've wished you hadn't installed the game in the first place. 10/10 would not recommend if you are looking for a friendly community that openly welcomes new gamers. However, as mentioned above, it is quite enjoyable to play with people you know who understand the mechanics of the game as well as the importance of drafting the right heroes based on the opponents' picks.",-1,1,0

If you bought Fallout 3 for all the shooting, gore, explosions, well, in my opinion, you SHOULD NOT have gotten it. You got to treat this game like an RPG, not an FPS. Anyways, the game has a good story to say the least; it's a good story in my case. The game works with a leveling system, which is pretty cool. Weapons, clothing, armor, items, radio stations, this game is filled with stuff. There is a HUGE variety of monsters to fight, NPC's to talk to, companions, etc. For me, you like this game or not. It just simply is like that. Then comes the MODS. Mods are pretty cool, but the game is older than most games, so not too much good mods are being made anymore.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Ridiculous amounts of plot holes. Village full of magically invincible children (not for the game's sake, but for the lore's sake, the mutants going to Big Town could easily waltz into Little Lamplight instead). Project Purity releasing huge amounts of radiation for no reason. BoS being anything but introverts. The list goes on.  Your choices don't matter. The enclave will always be your enemies and you must side with the Brotherhood of Steel for the main quest line, but let's not get started on the BoS love brigade. In addition, pacifist runs are not possible.  Companions are broken as hell. If you are high-levelled, companions are virtually invincible and will tank everything only to lose at most 2 bars of health. Maybe it's a good thing if you're tired of the level scaling. Yeah, there's also level scaling.  Blow up an entire town? Don't worry, you can make up for it by giving water to a homeless guy. The game is heavily dependent on its karma system and people will magically guess if you're good or bad and shun you from places or put hits out on you.  The game ends with a you going into a room full of lethal radiation to die because 'it is your destiny!' If you have the Broken Steel DLC, only then you have the option to send a companion in, three of which would be just fine (a super mutant, a robot and a ghoul, who are all resistant to radiation for their own reasons).

218230,PlanetSide 2,"So why the heck would you want to play this game? These are my reasons:  - Combined warfare (on land and in the air) at an unprecedented epic scale. Up to 2000 players on 64 square km maps: Seeing is really believing and the insane battles constantly keep you smiling. Popular saying: 'Planetside 2 is the closest thing you experience to real war'. - Cooperation between players goes a lot deeper than existing shooters. Once you've joined a good outfit, which is highly recommended, a complete new game play experience opens up to you.  - Solid gun and vehicle mechanics. No Battlefield netcode and hit detection bullsshhit, which is pretty amazing for a game on this scale. Weapons and vehicles feel tight and are fun to use, especially the unique empire specific ones.They're pretty well balanced too as devs are constantly on top of it. - You can be whatever you want to be and change within seconds. Whether it be long range cloaker sniper, a mechanized exoskeleton killing machine, a jumpjet light assault, a bomber gunner, a frontline support medic, there's a use for every role to specialize in in this game. The class system is fantastic in this game and the option to instantly switch classes and load-outs allows you to react quickly to the tactical situation and gives a ton of variety and depth to the game play. - There's a lot more to it than just shooting (if you are open to it): There are many tactical and strategic aspects to this game that open up to you once you've joined an outfit. - The large scale battles create an unique dynamic where no fight is the same and hilarious moments can always occur. Watching 50+ huge Galaxy dropships simultaneously kamikaze into your home base is just another day at the office for this game. Popular saying: 'Planetside 2 has more Battlefield moments than all Battlefield titles combined.' - Lively, friendly and mature community where you really get to know players. Just like in other MMOs, clans/ outfits often become close friend communities that actually meet up in real life. - Continuous development where developers are in close contact with the players, who a have strong influence on the development and get to vote on the roadmap. You can even make suggestions during live work-in-progress dev streams and literally see your ideas implemented in the game. - Great, colourful atmosphere with day and night cycle. Watching the colourful laser/tracer/fireworks shows never gets boring. This video is a good example how beautiful this game can be:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ65goFZ-64  - It is free to play without being pay to win. You should be well able to compete with the best (even as a new player) without ever spending a dime on this game. Your starter weapons are considered the best allround weapons in the game and other guns you can buy or as well play for are side-grades, not upgrades, designed to favour a more specific play style.  So why would you NOT want to play this game?  - When defined matches with a clear winner and loser is your thing. This game includes a 2 hour mini-game called Alert and also you can conquer continents to kick the enemy out, but otherwise you are playing on a persistent world map in a meaningless war without end. it's basically and endless Battlefield Conquest mode. - If you are going for instant, brainless, solo playing, run &amp; gun fun. Well this is all perfectly possible in this game, you have to get a hang of the battle flow of this game first in order to consistently find good fights and be successful solo. In the beginning you will just die a lot and it takes some time before you really understand the gigantic maps and game mechanics. Playing in teams/ outfits is heavily recommended if you want to improve quickly. - If you want a game that is 'finished'. This game is a multi-year project. It was good (albeit rough) at launch ( Metacritic 8,4 ) but has been improved so much however that it now ranks as very good ( third best shooter of all time by PC Gamer) and will even further dramatically improve with the planned strategic and tactical additions that are scheduled on the road map . However, constantly improving this game also means bugs and issues (who usually get squeezed quickly by the devs) regularly popping up with every new patch. - If you are going for fair fights. 'Size matters' is the slogan of this game and you will regularly find yourself fighting overwhelming numbers (zergs) or being part of an overwhelming force yourself. Defending against the odds is possible but difficult. Your best bet is to join a public squad/ platoon or outfit and choose a fight where you as a team can make a difference.   TL, DR: This game is basically a Space Battlefield on crack. Massive scale shooters are the future of gaming for sure and this game is just ahead of its time. Once you've played this game how its best to be played, by being part of a good outfit, going back to Battlefield/COD type of games just feels like a small scale and shallow experience.  10/10",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,This game sucks I got stuck in low priority for having to leave once from a game and now I can't get out of it cause I have to win and keep getting stuck with teammates that leave every 2 seconds.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Clicker Heroes is, well, a clicking game. And yes, the game is a bit addicting. And, probably, the only thing good about this game is it's art style. And that's it.   Clicker Heroes is a game where you click rapidly on enemies to kill them. Everytime you kill one, they give you coins, which allow you to level up your characters, buy characters, and buy upgrades. That is all the game has to offer, besides a little bit of good artwork. Clicker Heroes is also an online game, which was a GREAT idea. You dont even need to do ANYTHING, and you still get stuff. I mean, REALLY!?!?  I would not recommend this horrible game to ANYBODY, other than people with no lives. It is a bit addiciting,if you even play the game. I played this game for 15 minutes, and 15 minutes is all i ever WANT to play. The most 'heroic' click YOU can do, is click 'Delete Local Content' for this game. This only MY opinion of this game. Some may like it, (I don't know why ANYONE would like this game), but i personally hate this game, and don't recommend it.",-1,1,0

I believe this used to be a free mod a while back for HL2. Some of the maps look really similar to some I've played on a mod for HL2. However, the gameplay feels a little sluggish/squishy now.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"A brilliantly simple hack and slash game, complete with satisfyingly gruesome dismemberment and decapitation. The controls are excellent and provide a fun challenge in mastering the timing of chain attacks with different weapons. The game is online multiplayer only and there are a good variety of game modes, with the objective based games (For example, pushing a cart of corpses into an enemy water supply) being the most fun. The game runs very smoothly even on full servers and the chaos you'll find here is very much like medieval warfare. Teamkilling is practically a part of the game as accidents happen very, very fequently, but its hilarious rather than frustrating (Dont expect to go on a 20 kill rampage, your team mate will probably behead you first lol).  I find this to be a great pick up and play game, and have lost many, many fun filled hours to it. My only gripes would be that the levelling up system doesnt really seem to offer that much advancement or exciting new weapons to use and there could be more maps to play on. Other than that, I'd say grab some frineds and give it a try! Highly recommended if you fancy something a bit different from an FPS or are into the Medieval setting.",1,0,1

One of the problems is language barriers, with especially Russians playing on EU west just to shorten qeue time but then don't speak English so they can't communicate with the rest of the team. Another problem are the players that ruin the game experience for everyone on purpose. This includes people shouting at team members, people who feed on purpose, people who will get out of the way to get you killed, or people who try to make your progress in a match worse. Once Valve actually tries to do something about the players the game will become very good. Up until that point I can't recommend it since there are too many bad games ruined by these people and too little games with teams that are actually working together.",-1,0,0

Neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Where do I start with this one?  Ok, so this game is a very basic medieval combat simulator. Swing your sword, shoot your bow, throw your axe or fire your catapult and grotesquely dismember your foes among castles and vallies of a time long pass! Or, just ragequit after high levels of frustration.  So what's fun about this game? The use of medieval weapons like swords and shields, the arena style gameplay, and dismemberment physics that are gore and blood done right!  The bad? Pretty much everything else. I managed to do pretty well in a short amount of time, climbing the scoreboards and getting over the noob hump relatively quick. Unfortunately in my group of friends, I was the only one. Everyone I was playing with could not get used to glitch exploitation and angry MW players that are more obtuse than that little troll the billy goat had to stomp da' ♥♥♥♥ out. The game also disconnected a fair amount and had a lot of lag issues.  Overall the gaming experience is skin deep and the gameplay feels like a mod, not an officially released game. I know, I know, this game was originally a mod. But that's no excuse for this game being so glitchy and unpolished, especially since they seem to release DLC for an otherwise messy game.

As for the guy in the neg review(on steam) complaining about players playing on the side with the most players.and never playing as the underdog...well maybe he should play on Connor as the VS and platooon with JENK or DPSO sometime..jenk loves the underdog role(Yes you cant spawn tanks as fast,or maxs as much-but they give a nice xp+ bonus to the underdogs...so is nice for cert grinds)...And it takes team work and 3-4 dedicated sundre drivers to spawn on,which viods out the spawn room altogather...for someone with 480+ hours..that guy sure in the hell dont know how to play this game...So anyone who says that should stop trying to play solo in a game where each cont. caps at 2k players..seems kinda pointless dont it?  The game has built in Voice with indepentent voice leveling for players,which is a plus,seems to work pretty well.Volume lvlin at first for ppl can be a pain,but once you do it its done perma(kinda intresting to see where it save that at-im sure that file can get big after you ajust the vol for 400+ ppl and more)  The game has ground and air combat(which is why i quit WOT-the 15 vs 15 3 min matchs in that game drove me insane,while in PS2 i can run around in a vangaurd for a hour-get 30+ kills and never die which is nice.Plus the maps being so big also makes it nice for having a good armor groups to just push through the enemie.  All the game takes is team work...the tools to do so effectently are there.Its just alot of players dont use them...if theres alot of tanks on the ground...pull out some Heavy air/max's or if theres heavy air,so pull out ESF's with anti air maxes/tanks with anti air...it just takes team work.Now if ya get a group of players just running around lost and (as the guy in the NEg review pointed out) just spawning and dieing and spawning and dieing in a spawn room,ditch that area and spawn somewhere else jump in a sundr open up chat and type in reginally 'hey have a sundr spawning near *** stop spawning in the spawn room....and get them to spawn on you and kick whos ever it may be your fightings a**(inless you fighting the NC of course-then spawning in the spawn room is a great ideal..just do that,we like easy kills)",1,0,1

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Five Nights at Freddys, also known as FNaF, is a great game. Honestly, I used C D + on the last night (And 20/20/20/20 mode) just so I could get the stars, but that's not the point. FNaF has a GREAT storyline: Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was shut down after the parents and children reported 'Disgusting Body Odor' coming from the animatronic animals. You play the role of the night guard, and you have 3 objectives: Close the doors, Check the lights, and Survive 5 (7) nights. Go pick this game up, give it a go, and say hello to Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, Foxy, Golden Freddy, and a whole lot of scares.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"A faster paced Total War game. I recommend this for all strategy game fans.  The faster pace is a blessing and a curse, I miss large combats that took a moment longer, but while playing I realized that the faster combats are actually quite fun, there is less waiting to move to the enemy and more fighting. Altough I miss the strategy of maneuvering around the enemy, I enjoy the action as well.  I like the new sieges as well (sue me), they represent a different scool of sieges, more like movies instead of history. I enjoy rushing to the tower blind spots and using siege towers to get up on the walls. It again takes away some elements of the game but adds more action to it.  On the campaign map the game feels like a stripped down total war with roleplay elements. I miss having to actually manage my cities, but as an avid RPG fan I absolutely adore the new heroes and the quest battle system. I hoped for more depth in all aspects of the campaign map, but as a whole the gameplay is really enjoyable. Some factions play styles fit me better than others, so finding the one you like might take more than a single campaign.  I wrote this after playing around 130 hours and I plan on spending many more with this game.  Edit. After numerous DLC packs I'm being drawn back in to the game, addition of new races breathes a fresh new perspectives into the game. I'm not a fan of horde mechanics in this game, but I'm looking forward to the woodelves.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"When I first heard about PlanetSide 2, my thoughts were that since its free to play its probably not that great. Then I figured I had nothign to lose if I tried it. Ive been playing ever since. Let me tell you something about this game, it will blow your mind. Open world, multiplayer combat utilizing infintry combat, armored combat, and aerial combat. Pick one of three factions, the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate, or Vanu Sovereignty then jump into the fight any way you like. Dont like playing with groups? Fine go solo. Want to find a group to play with, with an established rank structure? Join a squad or platoon. Whant to form a group to operate as infintry, armor or an air force? Form a squad and get to it. With 3 giant continents (seriously, they are quite big) with no zoning on the continents you can run your platoon of armor from one side to the other with no stops (except to conquer bases), and if you feel that driving is too slow, take to the skies as either a fighter/bomber, high altitude support or crew transport aircraft each with their own weapons and roles. There is so much that you can do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. If you are serious about FPS games, this should be tried without hesitation.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Going into this game, I was willing to accept that I would die alot. I was willing to accept that there would be players that have played much longer than me, and would be much better than me. Even still, this game left a terrible taste in my mouth. I felt like i was dropped into the fight with nearly 0 explaination as to what was going on (played throught the tutorial too), what my objectives were, or who I was even supposed to shoot at. Gunplay and shooting felt clunky and awkward, and the game simply does not look good. I don't have a monsterous rig, but it performs very well in most games, but this isnt the case with Planetside 2. Even at medium settings, I am only able to squeeze out an unbearable 15-25 FPS during fights, which, to me, is when it matters most. Aside from that, there is no story to be had, just a 'shoot the guy not wearing the same color as you' game. Granted, I didn't expect a lot of story, but I got absolutely nothing. As mentioned before, I hated the gunplay, as none of the shooting felt quite right. I could overlook it if there was a story behind the game, but...  Overall, If you have some sort of ungodly computer capable of running this game at higher settings, don't mind zero story and awkward gunfights, and you don't mind dying over and over without feeling like you are accomplishing anything, this game is for you.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I have tried this game during free weekends and finally decided to buy it in the hope that they had fixed the terrible game play. Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.  It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.  If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"To start this off, people have thousands of hours in this game as you can leave it running while you're doing other things.  --  Clicker Heroes is, in my eyes, the pinnacle of the idle/clicking/incremential genre.   This is not a genre for everyone, it's for those of us who have compulsive loot-chasing instincts. The goal is pretty much the satisfaction of faster and faster progress, and bigger and bigger numbers. The game starts off incredibly slow, you click hundreds of times, and if you only play for half an ahour, that's what you'll think it is.  You click and click, and then you get enough money to buy your first hero, Treebeast. When you hire treebeast, the enemies will start taking continious damage over time, and the higher you level your heroes, the more damage they do.   Eventually, you make your way up to Amenhotep, and you can buy his 'Ascension' skill. What this does, is it takes away all your hero levels, and plops you right back at level one. WAIT, COME BACK  When you get to the higher levels, you start aquiring 'Hero Souls', and for every hero soul you hold on to, all damage by you and heroes is increased by ten percent, so you'll start progessing faster, further, and deeper.  Once you get enough, you can start spending those hero souls on 'Ancients', which are extremely beneficial passive effects, and the game will shift to leveling up the Ancients, and less about the heroes.   The developer has been shooting updates and patches practically bi-weekly, and they've added incredible content.  *Relics (Loot that drops once per ascension that grants additional passive benefits)  *Clans (up to 10 players, a message board, and daily 'Raids', which are incredibly tough bosses that last 24 hours, and will give everyone who participates in killing them hero souls based on their participation and damage done)  *Holiday events  *Followers (Think WoW's garrison quests)  There will be those who are turned off just because it's a free to play game, but there is literally no pay to win, everything you can buy is stuff that you get in game extremely easily. The developers also clearly love this game, they can't stop adding stuff to it.  This is an incredibly insidious game, and it's very, very addictive if you have the patience to learn it. When I'm not playing it on Steam, I am also playing it on my phone.  I highly recommend this to all fans of loot based games such as Diablo, WoW, etc, as it will really, REALLY scratch that gear grind itch.   ---  I consider this game one of my Mandatory Steam Games, and a must-have.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"+ Probably the deepest, most complex MOBA there is + Massive cast of heroes with huge variety and each with a very unique playstyle + 100% free, all heroes available, no pay-to-win, microtransactions are cosmetic only, and there are endless ways to pimp out your heroes, HUD, announcer and more.  PROTIP:  most people know this but if you are looking to buy items check the Marketplace, you can buy from other players usually much cheaper than from the official store. + Despite only 1 official map, every game feels totally different due to endless combinations of heroes and builds + Devs put a lot of effort into balancing, updates are very frequent + Active and talented modding community, tons of fun, crazy custom game modes to play + Tons of servers available including South Africa and SEA + Tons of settings to tweak in terms of controls and HUD options so you can play exactly how you want- a big deal in a game where technical skill and response time is very important  ~ Won't be a concern for most people but the AI for computer-controlled bots is really terrible, and they play nothing like actual humans. Unless you're learning the very basics of the game practicing against bots will actually teach bad habits and adversely affect your skill. ~ LAN play is supported, however you still need to have an internet connection to launch the game ~ Personally, I feel that although the variety of cosmetic items is nice, many of the more expensive items have really flashy, over the top particle effects that can make already visually cluttered teamfights very hard to follow. As of this review there is no option to disable custom cosmetics.  - (In it's current state) very little rubber-banding or comeback mechanics. Unless all players are exactly equal in skill, once one team starts winning they will continue to snowball to inevitable victory, and playing from behind in DOTA is one of the most painful and frustrating experiences in videogames - Extremely steep learning curve, not to mention the game is constantly changing, coming back after a month almost feels like playing an entirely different game - Like most online games, the community is absolute cancer - Like most online games, playing alone is absolute cancer   WARNING: Personal sob-story ahead. There was a time when I was so addicted to DOTA that I neglected my studies, social life, my health, pretty much everything else. It ultimately culminated in a bit of a breakdown, and since then I only play when my friends get together for a LAN. Now, I obviously don't blame all my problems on the game, there were a lot of factors that led me to that point in my life, but DOTA was definitely a big one. Not everyone will get hooked like I did, but I do think the game is inherently quite addictive. Due to the very high skill ceiling, you want to keep learning and getting better, and it's very satisfying when you win, but very discouraging when you lose. You'll keep coming back no matter how many times it beats you down because that high from pulling off a close victory is really exhilarating. Those of you who have played Dark Souls know what I mean. The difference with DOTA is that you'll never actually beat the game- there is no final boss, just the next match, and the next match, and the next. Anyway, just something to keep in mind.    TLDR:  It's the definitive MOBA experience, but not for the faint-hearted. An extremely technical game. Would only reccommend if you have some friends to LAN with, it's free at least.",-1,0,0

Helicopters offer the ability to stabalize, hover, and straif - which actually allows for some combat to take place.  There are a select few weapons that are practicle, because this game plays like shooting fish in a barrel. You are either the fish for that round or the ones shooting. There is 0 varried gameplay, a select few who have appreciated and mastered this title, and then there are brainless doorknobs which take up about 40% of who plays this. Luckily, that's still 60% WORTH of a decent player base. This fact does not save it from being a particularly dull and boring shooter.

I also enjoyed some good blood shedding Skyrim style for a little while. So, in the end I can see why people are liking this.  To me personally however, it ended up feeling too clunky for multiplayer combat. The battles felt unfocused and I was in no way inspired by it to continue. Got bored way too quickly. Not that it's easy (on the contrary), but it's just not something I even want to get good at. Everything just doesn't come together for me or drag me in.  Even while it was on sale, I am so disappointed with this one, that I have found this a waste of my money....",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Updated this review... read on for my original and further down is my updated version:  I've played this game on and off since almost release, and in short form, it's essentially a great free game, however one with a fair few major flaws.  Ads: + Excellent graphics + Varied Classes and Factions - they really do feel very unique + Large Battles (well large is quite a large understatement here...) + Varied Maps + (The potential for...) Good teamplay + FREE  Disads: - Takes a long time to earn Cert points - in game currency, (and...) - Higher priced weapons are very good - The majority of the bases are fairly similar, leading to repetitive gameplay - Imbalance in server population (spikes of a majority of one faction, leading to domination of map) - Server population has been reducing - Can run fairly poorly  8.5/10  (EDIT):  Ever since Daybreak has taken over, I no longer can recommend the game:  - Updates seem to be getting worse and worse that seem to fix nothing but cause even more bugs to appear, which is clearly a little crazy, and also incorporate yet more crap into the game. Age old bugs and issues from launch have not been solved, and despite attempts at solving performance issues there is not a great difference.  - The server population has completely been obliterated (you may not notice it at first, but the reason for this is that they have merged a very many number of servers together, and even with this, the reduce in player numbers is still very noticable).  - Not only this but the community has become completely toxic. There is absolutely no fun to be had here anymore when not playing with friends - I warn you, do not play without friends.   - I've noticed many more cheaters and aimbotters as of late, much higher than I had seen playing this game previously.   - Lots of items have inexplicably been completely nerfed whilst others remain untouched?   - Over time and updates the graphics of the game have become worse, so that if you were to compare them now to what they were a few years back, you'll see a huge difference. The game has turned from an absolutely beautiful masterpiece to a fairly mediocre, or even perhaps at times sub-par looking game (and that's taking into account the graphics of other games getting better). Don't believe me, check out screenshots online.   - And finally the killer is the fact that this game is now clearly a cash-cow. Stupidly high prices for weapons and evidently not a lot of effort is being put in here.   Writing this review hurts me, because at one point this was my favourite game, and still there is a part of me that adores it. But by taking a clear picture it is evident to see the downfall that this game has had since it was released and compared to the original Planetside. This game, like the original Planetside was hugely ahead of its time, and it had the potential to be something truly revolutionary. But in recent months it's clear the dream will never be met... There was so much potential here for something greater, and it's been wasted.   A damn shame. :((",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 is a shooeter where three factions are pitted against eachother on combat over four unique continents; Indar, the Desert continent, Esamir the icy wasteland, Amerish the lush and mountainous landscape and Hossin, a thick swamp. Every faction gets fun to use equipment for dealing with the situations and terrains present on each continent, and it's a bundle of fun to play. Organized outfits (the clans/guilds of Planetside 2) can be found on every faction of every server.  You won't regret picking up this game, the battles are huge and involving and you can make a huge impact as just a single player in these huge fights. The game is sexy, runs fairly decently in even the huge fights involving over 200+ people (I run with 16gb of RAM, an I3-2120 and a GTX 970, and I get at least 30 fps in all situations, with over 60 in most situations).  The fact that it is free is just a huge icing on the cake, and honestly if I had to make a suggestion on the microtransations, then I can only say that buying guns with real-life money is wasteful at best. The guns do not take an overly long time to grind for ala other F2P games, and it's definitely a million times more rewarding to find get that gun you've been saving for ages for instead of skipping to it. If you feel like supporting Daybreak Games, the company that runs this game, then I suggest purchasing only aesthetics as it is a million times more fun to grind the guns manually.  My only gripe with the game currently, as of April of 2015, is that there a quite a few prevalent game-breaking bugs that make the game tough to play when they arise. However, these bugs only pop up in fringe situations and can be fixed easily with a minor inconvinience. It is very easy to see past these bugs, and it should not be an off-putting factor for anyone on the fence about trying out this game.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"SCAM! Pay full price for the game and they still want you to pay another $20 to unlock each faction.  Game mechanics are difficult and do not seem to fit this sort of game.   CAMERA VIEWS are limited: Zoom will zoom very close except the army/character panel will cover up what you want to zoom to see. One might attempt to simply change to god-mode and look straight down in order to see the zoom...but....there is no option for that camera mode.  CYCLING through units is broke: Cycling through units seems to be random. Whether keeping to the right or left, the cycle will jump back to units you have just been on. keep clicking in one direction will not systematically cycle from one toon to the next without repeating. This makes tracking large amounts of units difficult and even caused me to lose a campaign because I cycled through troops until i eventually landed back on the one I started on....wrong! The cycle skipped some units entirely. A feature that removes a unit from the cycle once it has exausted all movement would be best. Also a feature that we can check a box to leave that unit out of the cycle for a turn. Hero abilities stop randomly: Some hero abilities were acivated and left alone. Sometimes they would still be active after a couple turns, sometimes they would have been turned off.  BALANCE seems to be way off. I played the dwarves (easy) also on easy mode and barely won. Play the empire (normal) in easy mode and get wiped by the AI. Seems as though the AI is granted double or triple movement points, not to mention they start with more armies.  Another campaign I was attacking with a full 20 army the moment I recruited my last army, I attacked and noticed the balance meter indicated I had like a 1% change (the bar was almost all red in favor of the enemy). How in the world can the AI gather such massive armies in the same time it took me to build just 1 leader with a full 20 slots? The sheer time on waiting enough turns to make that money in the first few turns while the AI has double or triple the funds means there's some major imbalance here.  HERO UNBALANCE: WTF? My last campaign had a level 13 hero assasinating a level 2 enemy with 100% failure rate. On the final assination attempt it was a critical failure and my level 13 hero died after trying to assinate a level 2 over 10 times. Other AI assinations seem to have had a 50% success rate while mine had a 1% success rate (yup, in turn 78 i got my first assination out of dozens and dozens of attempts and failures) and the game was in easy mode. So is the difficulty adjustment broken?  BATTLES are ok. I can see that these are the primary reason behind this game. Unfortunately this is a turn based game but there are no turns in the battle. Scrolling and panning to get a view you like of the battle field is annoying. try to zoom in to see some units in the trees and your screen will be blocked by the trees. I love the graphics, but, they should get clipped out of the camera view if I zoom to a certain point. Also, zooming out does not give a full view of the battlefield, leaving a lot of units out of sight. Tutorials are lacking and it was not until after a few failed campaigns and battles that I discovered that your hero/lord/leader abilities/spells had to be manually cast.  First few campaigns are annoying. TONS of pop ups, pauses for the tutorials, quests, cut scenes, narration...etc. Click once and sit back and let the game play itself for a few minutes then jump back in and click a couple more times to wait while the game plays itself (not talking about the other factions taking their turns, that's expected).   All the positive aspects are that this game is a challenge and it is very encompassing with the alliance/diplomacy system. Diplomacy will make or break your strategy.  Wish steam would adopt a different rating system. Thumbs up or down leads us to think we rate the games as they either suck or they dont.  Sadly, i give this a thumbs down because I paid full price and upon opening the game, I expect to be able to play the full game. Instead I am limited to playing only a handfull of the races while being told I now have to pay another $20 for the privelege of playing the races that I paid for in teh first place.   The TRICKERY and DECEPTION of trying to dupe me into PAYING for the ability to play all the factions is unappreciated. Also the ONLY FREE DLC is broken. I click on the box that says 'Yes, I already have Steam' and nothing happens, but, click on the box 'No, I need to install Steam' and that box works just fine. I paid full price. just let me download that one free dlc pack. Likewise, because of this trickery, I will NEVER purchase any other DLCs for this game.",-1,1,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"This is a game that I have enjoyed throughout the years, first on Xbox, now on PC. I have never unti now, however, experienced the full Game of the Year Edition. And boy am I experiencing it.   If you are considering buying Fallout 3, I wholeheartedly recommend it. It is a beautiful open-world RPG set in the post-nuclear remnant of an America that never moved on from the 1940's. The sad, bleak atmosphere is one of the most amazing parts of the game. As for the gameplay, it couldn't be more flawless. The weapons are all so satisfying to use, and the weapon diversity is great; it's loads less crowded than the next installment, New Vegas. I recommend ramping the difficulty up to Hard or Very Hard to see just how well you can survive the harsh Capitol Wasteland. Perks and skills are earned as you level up, and some of them (I'm looking at you, Bloody Mess) can make the game very interesting. There are many viable playstyles. I usually use Small Guns and Melee Weapons early on in the game and start using more Energy Weapons and Big Guns later. It seems to flow naturally that way. All in all, it is a very satifying game.  The expansions/add-ons included in this Game of the Year Edition bundle are some of the most incredible, diverse, and interesting expansions I have seen in video games. Point Lookout gives the feeling that I'm stuck on Crazy Island or something. It's nuts. It adds some really powerful weapons like my favorite, the Lever-Action Rifle. Operation: Anchorage is my favorite out of all the expansions. The story and gameplay it adds are tons of fun. It sends you back in time to this war with China and the battlefront is Alaska. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The Pitt takes you the slavery capitol of the post-apocalyptic world: Pittsburgh! Lots of cool adventures to be had in the steel mills. The atmosphere of the Pitt is very dark and fiery. It's rather scary. And no one is nice there. I don't want to live there. Mothership Zeta is probably my second favorite of the add-ons. You get abducted by aliens who want to study you, so you escape and blast their faces with their super awesome alien guns. Quite enjoyable. Finally, Broken Steel adds post-game content. Without the Broken Steel expansion, when you finish the main questline of the game, that's it. Boom. The game is over. Can't play anymore. But if you have this add-on, you get to keep playing after beating the game using the same file! Also, the level cap gets raised to 30 from 20. This adds loads of awesome Perks to get. I was so excited to get the Puppies! perk since my dog died like right after I got him. So sad. But now I have a new one! Not sad!  I have enjoyed this game quite a lot, and I can continue to enjoy it. There are so many quests to do, so many different choices to make, so many things to shoot, and there is even an atom bomb to blow up (or not :D)! Please, go and enjoy Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"I love mobas. As far as PC games go, it's my favorite genre. I've played the original Dota for years. League of Legends and I've dabbled in Smite and HoN. Dota 2 beats all of them as far game play, balance, hero design. It has holiday events, free skin drops. They allow you the option to sell your skins and other drops in the community market. My steam wallet is sitting at over $40 as we speak strictly from Dota 2 community market sales.  There is one critical flaw in this game. I can honestly say, that in my personal experience over 95% of the players can not, or will not speak english. Not in text, not on the mic. This makes team strat damn near impossible for an english speaker. The game allows you to check which servers and language you want to be included in - any that you leave unchecked will not add you to the matchmaking system in those locations/languages. I live in the US, and I can only speak english. So I only have US servers and english checked. Yet still every game I feel like a foreigner in my countries own servers.  I ask them why they click US/English if they can't speak the language, but it's a redundant question since they have no clue what I'm saying.  There really is no excuse for it and sadly enough it ruins the whole experience for me. I might as well be playing with bots.  In conclusion I will say that this is a great game. But unless you speak every other language except english, you're going to want to go play something else.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"It was good in 2013-2014. But since 2015 many have begun to use methods to manipulate the swinging system. (reverse overheads, aka rainbows ; literally spins to do accelerated drags which make absolutely no sense in any way, and so on.) Some moves (drags) make some sense, and don't look like someone is literally just dancing with a messer, between 3 people, decapidating each one of them, with one move, while abusing the stupid animations.  I didn't want this game to be fully realistic, but some semi-realistic aspects and some fixes for this poorly designes system would've been welcomed. But, it was too late. They now moved on their next game, and will probably abandoned this one soon.  Like one once said:  Game style: Not F2P, not P2W, but S2W  Spin to Win. 180/360  Edit: for those who want another game that has the potential of crushing chivalry, should check Mordhau. Please do.

The graphics are top, the visuals of the battles are cinamatic worthy and the lore is spelended. Only one hour in campain and Im already hooked. The release is very stable, especially for a Total War game. I just have a few flicking UIs that I know would be fixed very soon  NOTE: This isnt your typical Total War game nore is it a Warhammer game. It's a combination of both games and it was pulled off well. What makes this different? *Combat is more faster paced *Cities on the campain map are a bit closer to eachother. Think of Shogun 2's campain map. *Hero/Commanders are a one unit squad *Heroes can have mounts! * MAGIC ON THE BATTLEFIELD, BIG PLUS *Campain has alot of changes, This includes how tech works and political stuff *Special Units and different classes example: 'Big units' would be the Giant orges   I will add more stuff to this later on when I find new stuff. But I highly reccomend this game.  Go get it so we can play co-op campain! SEE YOU IN BATTLE! ",1,0,1

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I dont play (ok, played) this on my PC but on my Tablet.. I thought I write my warning here..  The game is a time waster.. very good one.. and became with the last update even MORE time waster. Let me explain. The game is a resource game.. running in real time. You can play it clicking your ♥♥♥ off, play it idle and do nothing at all beside a few clicks every here and then.. or a mix of both.  I played a mix, as sometimes I want to click a bit and other times I prefer to sleep! :p So for 5 days I wasted my time.. and I felt very sorry for myself during game time.. why am I wasting my life with this? Anyhow.. got myself a little setup and reached Lv400 in 50min on my farm run for hero souls. Got about 350 on average on a run. Skilled mainly chance to spawn a Primal Boss and Hero Souls drop amount plus more gold in IDLE mode. I was happy wasting my time... and the update came.. no question, do you want to upgrade? Just suddenly I got way more Hero Souls.. niiiice, what a lucky run.. when I hit over 1k Souls.. I started to understand, something goes different as usual. Bed time.. started game again next day and screen pops up.. Transcence bla bla.. Help Screen to explain it all.. like a lerner driver gets this instruction: Open Door of the car, start car, drive as it is demanded by law, park and exit car. So.. basicly nada! Next I start my run.. why are my heroes not guilded anymore?? Why does all take soooooooo much longer? To make it short.. that is what r2games sold you. We made a upgrade and BALANCED the game. How unbalanced it was before.. example: My next upgrade for chance to get a primal boss was 72 Hero Souls... after the update +86k Hero souls.. so the developper thought it needed a balance to a skill that was 1 : 1200 out of balance. Yes, but we gave you more Hero Soul income too... true.. went from 400 average to 1500 on a run.. lets say 4 time more... to 1200 more cost.. my same farm run of 50min is now over 3 hours... and instead of beeing able to upgrade my chance for hero boss 3 times on one farm run to 400.. I would need over 50 runs for 1 upgrade. So wasting time is one thing, this is just simply super stupid.. I guess to many people came to the end of 'get arthritis when you are old game'.. and instead of putting some brain into it.. they just made everything a s h i t l o a d take more time.  So all in short: If you want to kill your last brain cells with boredom, if you cant understand or play games, which demands at least an IQ of 90.. this is your game and you will LOVE it!!! In any other case.. do yourself a favor, man... drill yourself a hole in your head.. makes more sense than playing this game for brain dead idiots. This is THE game for street cleaners, garbage men and bums living under the bridge.. about the IQ you need to play this junk and think this is a great game..",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"The only way I would be able to recommend this game to players would be if you had 5 constant friends to play the game with. If you play the game as a sole individual you will encounter a world of toxic hate never seen before on any video game in existence.   In every single Dota game you can expect people to be any or all of the following 1) Rude 2) Egoistical  3) Toxic 4) Ill mannered 5) High and mighty  Gameplay wise, it's one of the best games around but it's a game where team play prevails, which is why I can only recommend the game if you have friends to play the game with. Take my advice after almost 1,500 hours, if you come in to this game as a sole individual, teamplay with 5 people who don't like each other very much is just not going to happen. This game is not noob friendly in any way whatsoever, it's an extremely competitive game and only for the most hardcore of video game players.  You could probably just install this game and play the custom game modes, which are less competitive and more relaxed, but how could I even possibly recommend this game to my friends or other players when it's a game filled full of hate towards other players.  If I had to say the single biggest most important way Dota 2 could be improved then I would introduce a region lock that forced players to only be allowed to play with players that lived in the same country as them. As most of the toxic and hate stems from Western Europeans arguing with Eastern Europeans and half of your team doesn't even speak your language. The same happens on US servers where Peruvians are toxic to Americans and vice versa.",-1,1,0

This game is definitely strange, and is best played with a friend. I would recommend picking this game up on sale because of the lack of real content and solo play-ability.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"This garbage almost ruined christmas for me...  Great tutorial, horrible multiplayer  I joined one game, not a free for all but an objective. The objective was being ignored and everyone was killing on sight, even teams. It was nothing but team killing, I'm serious, I can't believe this game is overwhelmingly positive because that review needs to come down with the slew of negative reviews. I chose to ignore them because oft he review but because of this garbage I'm gonna be doing alot more research into any game I buy.  I heard this game was once great but not anymore, no one plays seriously and just wanna ruin it for others. I had one guy spawn camping by swinging his weapon in one place where people spawn in on so he could kill them as soon as they spawn. The first time it happened I put it down to one bad egg but then someone else joined in and chased down anyone who got away.  There was no Class Based Teamplay that I was promised, no working together, no good times. The only time I had fun was in the tutorial but thank god it was on sale for 90% off (I can see why now) else I'd have been severerely ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Why, you may ask? Simply because of the fact that its purely meant to consume your time.   You kill mosters by clicking or idling and use the gold which they drop to improve your character and buy heroes and imrpove those. So far for that. You do that until you reach lvl 130-140 where you simply never ever will pass the bosses. (too low dmg) Then, you restart the game. You gain Hero Souls, which give you dmg boosts if you keep them or can be used to buy other extras.  Thats it. You play the game util you can't proceed any further, then you resett, gain hero souls, play until you [...]  As always, there is the shortcut of paying. You can pay to improve your heroes, you can pay for hero souls, you can pay for relics, you can pay for basicly anything you want.   So... either play this for hundreds / thousands of hours (because there is no 'end' unless you count 100% achievements as finishing a game) or you ... quit halfway through. Optional, you don't play it at all, which i advise you to do.  The game is soley a waste of time and trying to get you spend money on it.",-1,1,0

Fun to show off your skills to other people.  CONS 1. There are smurfs that make alt steam accounts to get matched with lower people because they are too bad to play with people on their level. 2.

The modding community is there for you. So many possiblities and mods that make it amazing.   This is the most amazing game i have played. Full stop. No recent games have even gotten near Fallout on my list. It's just so bloody perfect.  Buy it if you don't have it. Get GOTY if you can. You won't regret it.

Pros-Really fun and from what I have played seems very well balanced. It embodies the warhammer fantasy universe well and a lot of the models look great in game.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Clicker Heroes  Just another idle game, a quaintly re-skinned Cookie Clicker with a ‘mobile games’ aesthetic. Nothing to rave about, but what’s there is solid, if only within its genre. More satisfying than comparable titles simply due to the layers of abstraction it places between the player and ‘watching the grass grow’; it’s more ‘interactive’.  The devs know their audience; the interplay between heroes, ancients and active abilities w/ cooldowns provides latitude for mathematical analysis - active players will want to invest differently from passive ones, for instance.  Scrupulous readers will notice the abundance of ‘pay-to-win’ complaints; but pay to win what, exactly? There are no leaderboards at the time of this writing, so basically all you’re paying for is hastening the experience of whiling away your time. Nevertheless, the game still manages to feels somewhat solicitous, and maybe it does have something to do with the presence of a cash shop.  tl;dr: Cookie Clicker for RPG enthusiasts - a baby step in the right direction.  *** 6/10 ***",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"The last review I've done of this game is outdated for years, yet the game changed so little on the bigger picture it's a disgrace to say that, but it's not worth playing. Not anymore. The population counts have been getting lower and lower, yet no one at DayBreak seems to care. Also note this isn't my real hour count, it's probably around 1k hours now.  - patches come at a very slow pace, expect not to see one after months of waiting. 'You want a patch ? Oh look, another weapon skins bundle !' - some weapons have been either underpowered or overpowered since day 1, yet never changed (TRAP &amp; directive weapons being garbage for example, fury on invisible flashes completely broken, as well as Air to Ground weapons). - the population counts getting lower and lower means you're going to see EXACTLY the same people playing from now on, and they'll often be the ones who sunk thoussands of hours in the game, so expect them to beat you everytime if you're not good at FPS'. Also, the autralian server is literally dead, with a peak of 500 players accross two continents, which is low, very low, while Connery, an US server, is probably going to get merged soon enough due to lower and lower pop counts aswell. - Despite its improvements, the new player experience will remain terrible : if you're an experienced FPS player, it's gonna be rough. If you're completely new to FPS genre, you're going to be eaten alive. Also there's no way for a new player to know exactly what attachments does what, since most of the stats are on the wikis &amp; stuff. - to get anything done in this game, you need a team. And it's either going to be completely moronic, or you're simply going to be outnumbered 4 to 1 on a base worth defending, while your faction has the biggest pop on the continent, fighting another base with 100+ players against 12 or something. - 4 years, and the lore is still lackluster &amp; almost absent from the game itself, even better, a lot of weapons are not from the factions, and the factions literally have 2 freaking vehicles for them : a heavy tank and an aircraft; while you have 8 other vehicles who look almost exactly the same, have exactly the same weapons accross all the 3 factions. - No viable anticheat, there're cheaters who're going through the walls, the ground, who're spinbotting with LMGs in the sky yet still playing, I'm talking about more than 100 hours in game without getting banned, this is just sad. - 4 years latter, lags and optimization are still garbage on battles with more than 100 people in.  So, let me ask you one question, is it worth for a new player to play planetside ?   I'd have answered yes in 2013, but in 2016 ? Unless you REALLY want to get into the bits of big fights left (which are going to disappear soon enough), be prepared to face huge frustration moments. Despite devs' recent progress for new players, it's already too late, since the new players don't stick around either way, nor even try the game. Only a relaunch could save its game after getting all the bugs and numerous cheesy weapons balanced.  ",-1,1,0

570,Dota 2,"(please forgive me if my wording is bad I don't normally write) I have played dota for too long, as it is a fun addictive game. However the players on it are judgementive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that brand a player (beginner or veteren) depending on who or how you play. E.g. the fairly new hero techies is frowned opon because he has low attack damage, a horrible attack animation, and three of his abilitys are pretty much useless when the other team is mainly ranged with true sight or has the ability to summon minions, or damage reduction abilitys (Templar assassins refraction). Or in some cases just because people have nothing better to do they will tell you to commit suicide because you're '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' and that no one would care if you did for this reason i do not recomend this game unless you are playing with a group of friends that wanna have fun.   I play league of legends every now and then and l and can say it's a much friendlyer game then dota but is slower then dota and much easyer to kill people but dota is more enjoyable if your teamates aren't simple minded ♥♥♥♥s  I rate this game 7/10",-1,1,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"READ FIRST, NO NEGATIVE REVIEW   I really like this game, played the normal version (Steam) for like 30 hours. But I wanted the DLCs and bought the GOTY in a sale. Turns out this is the hell. Idk what it is, but I can't get it to run for more like 20 minutes before crashing. Idk if it's the mods or the steam version, but well... I don't even use that many mods, because I knew modding Fallout 3 GOTY with Steam Version would be difficult. Just some graphic and UI changes and Ironsights. Not really much more... The thing is, if you want to play vanilla... Give it a try. But if you are going to mod this game, which I recommend for the most games Bethesda made, buy the CD version, since it seems way more stable. Maybe I will give it a try again when I got my new PC, but until that I will play New Vegas again, which runs highly modded on my PC, with no problems.

The guns feel great and their is a decent variety of weapons here with plenty of customization options for you to make your perfect killing machine with. The Map is also amazing the jungles are beautiful and there are a large amount of ruins and caves to explore. On top of that the game is populated with some down right amazing animals that will literally rip your ♥♥♥ a new one if you don't watch out for them. Overall i really enjoyed the experience and highly recommend buying it. I also recommend buying the deluxe edition of the game since Hurk from the monkey business pack is probably my favorite character in the game after Vaas that is :).  Here comes the bad news though. MP is complete crap as of release. Hopefully a few patches down the road it will be fixed but for now it is miserable. MP matches are filled with bugs, matches are hosted peer to peer making for a real lag fest, and in my case at least the game crashes at the end of every match. Although i do have to say the matches themselves are pretty fun while they are happening at least when you find a game with no lag.   Sadly I have to say the weakest point in the whole game is the Co-op. It has extremely linear game play, is as bug infested as MP, and lacks proper hosting or search options in menu leaving you with the options to either private match which requires 3 other friends to join before launching or you can hit join public which throws you into a random lobby with 3 strangers one of which will randomly be selected lobby leader and has complete control of the chapter selection and etc. :X.  Overall I would give this games SP a 8.5 out of 10, its MP a 3 out of 10 with the possibility of becoming an 8 out of 10 if they can fix the bugs and crashing, and i give the Co-op a whopping 1 out of 10 with the possibility of raising to a 4 out of 10 if they fix the freaking hosting options.",1,0,1

Its writing, story, main characters, and cannon related to the falloutverse are off or poorly done. What the main story and fallout history fail at, the world and everything else more then make up for those short comings. Inside is a deep world to explore with so many side quests and interesting places to see, its hard to not get lost and overloaded. Do yourself a flavor. Buy this game.",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"This is one of the best multiplayer FPS's I have ever played. The maps are huge, the graphics are beautiful, and there's a ton of customization. If you can get some friends to play it with you it will be a lot more enjoyable (other wise join a squad in-game).  Another huge plus is it isn't pay to win - although, paying does give you quicker access to weapons. It isn't remotely game breaking though, so I would say it's one of the best balances I have seen with a 'free' game that has buyable content.  The last huge plus for me was that anyone can play it and enjoy themselves, but there's still an extremely high skill cap for people that are skilled at FPS's.",1,0,1

This option is frustrating when you are trying to loot the enemy and you keep picking up their crappy weapon.

This ment I could pass Night 2-7 (4/20 mode) on my first try aslong as you follow a routine each night. A good thing to know before you play is that F2 resets the game but ESC quits the game.  On the overhand I don't recommend this game to anyone with a faint heart or is elderly as you will expect lots of jumpscares. (Which only so far I've had 1 and that was only on my first night.)

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"This game has an incredibly cool concept, and was fun for about a week. But now, I can see that this game has as many holes in it as swiss cheese, which the developers clearly don't care to repair.  Positive:  - Sweet customization: plenty of cool options to choose from. - Immersive gameplay; awesome war-like atmosphere. - Intelligent integration of technical striking, such as slashing, overhanding, uppercutting, jabbing, parrying, kicking, etc. - Interactive speech in-game. - Feel like a boss when you win a fight.  Negative:  - 'Dragging', a flat out abuse of the game's striking system which makes you nearly impossible to beat when holding a two-handed weapon. Throw's game balance off completely. (Specifically Claymores and Zweilhanders) - Cancerous community. People generally use all the abuses, and find all the loopholes to make the game hell for people who just want to have a fun, balanced game. People who abuse the system also mock you for pointing it out, and try to get you kicked. - Team killing. Not like this is that big of an issue, because you can't just walk into your allies' swings, and this makes it to where it's much harder to gang up on an opponent, which is perfectly okay, BUT half the time, teammates don't give a single crap about killing teammates in order to get kills, even though the game tutorial teaches you how to avoid friendly fire. You will find yourself the having more deaths by friendly fire than fire in some matches, which I find infuriating. - Team stacking: another example of total garbage in this game, is that strong players (usually draggers) like to all join one team, so they can have a field day with less experienced/less skilled players, giving some teams virtually no chance of winning at all.  The bad far outweighs the good, and is only fun when playing low ranked matches against people who haven't learned how to abuse the game's loopholes, or with friends. Even in low rank games, I've caught obvious people smurfing just to feel good about themselves for annihilating a bunch of noobs.  My recommendation is don't bother downloading, because this game will get your hopes up with its awesome, and immersive gameplay, but then destroy your hopes with the distinct, and obvious imbalances, that people don't mind abusing to ruin the entire game for everyone. You will be excited, because Chivalry: Medieval Warfare seems like a really awesome game on the surface, but then crushing disappointment will follow, because the community will suck the fun right out of it for you. So, again, I recommend that you don't put yourself through it, and don't waste a red cent on this crappy, beta, unrefined game.",-1,0,0

The reviews they give are true for the most parts and thats what really sad. Dont get me wrong this game is fantastic and yes i would recomend it. The one true flaw with this game is indeed the community. This community is one of the most toxic i have been exposed too since the first time I played leauge. I cant tell you how many times ive entered a free for all only to find out thats is actually a team death match in disguise and your on niether team so it just turns into a medival gangbang. If you try to voice your opinion you instantly get a barrage of negativity and people telling you how you are just inferior at the game though you are quite literally getting 5 v 1'd somtimes but oh no your just bad at the game. I long for the days when I was just a wee level 5 playing in the low rank server with my friends and you could have geniune fun just slashing at your enemys without them 1 hitting you or spinning around like a hurricane of death. I can't tell you how many times ive been a duel server only the get utterly destroyed and when you ask the person how they are doing that they insist that you are just bad and that you shoud stop playing the game. It's players like that that shouldnt be allowed to play the game cause they quite literally made me stop playing because i thought it was hopeless, but I always felt myself getting pulled back and to just try again and again.   Now im not saying that all of the high ranks are just meaners but its quite a high percentage of them. If it wasnt for the few high ranks that took time out of their day to spar with me, give me tips and pointers I dont know if i would have kept playing and I cant help but think for the other people that wernt as fortunate as myself and were pushed away from the game early because of this stuff and all the fun that they are missing because of it.   However this is one of the only games where when you level up on you actually feel like your leveling up in real life. Each level I gained after level 15 was not just given to me, I had to earn it. The more you play the more you will develop the eye to see things in the mechanics that you yourself can use to come out on top. This game is challenging and it is full of alot of BS things that people can use to kill you. But the more you play you will find your own BS to use against other people. At the end of the day high ranked battles are just who can do more stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ before your enemy can.   To sum things up is this a good game? Most definately. Would I reccomend it? Yes but definately if you have a friend to play with. Is the community the best? No its not but you will find those servers somtimes where everybody isnt a colossal ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Is there some things I think should be added to the game or fixed? Yes there needs to be some sort of team level balance system so all the level 50's cant stack one team and ruin everybodys fun and people dont think they are just doing something wrong.  Game: 9/10 Community: -9/10  Msg me if you wanna play sometime.  And dont complain about feinting it was actaually intened to be in the game.",1,1,1

When we was contacted by a wild Russian, then another and so forth. We fealt threatened so I used all that i had in my power to fight back against the Russian scourge. With a twisted grin and keg of ale, the Dapper Whale clicked report. Again and again on each Russian within my grasp, my grin was growing crooked. Now stretching across from cheek to cheek. I began to laugh and squeal with delight. At the power that was bestowed upon me. Imaging what i could do with this button, first i will report the Russians, THEN America, why stop there i might even attack China! I had reported every teamate but one. My friend. With a wry smile, and a cackle i whispered one utterance to my friend through a messenger pigeon called 'Skype' With a click and a report i felt that my work here was done and the game had lost all enterainment value for the day.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I was hyped and bought the game. I regret my decision. Probably a worthy pickup on sale, but full price? No   I liked the idea and the lore of Warhammer, put into a total war game. However, I don't like it anymore. The battles are plain boring, as the realistic style of Total War really doesn't do the epic fantasy battles of Warhammer much justice- and vice versa. I found the battles so boring I don't even fight them. This despite the fact that leaders have more abilites like spells- it still doesn't bring any feeling to the battles. So I found the most valid strategy is to mass cheap troops and autoresolve. Quite boring that, too. The AI works mostly ok in the campaign map, but is as usual quite stupid in battles.  I think RTS-games like Dawn Of War serve the Warhammer-like battles far better than putting them into a Total War-form.  So, it's not a bad game. But it's a very boring Total War-game. I would recommend buying Shogun 2 with Fall Of The Samurai and installing Darth Mod, and you will have a far superior game for a much smaller price. Alternatively, wait for this game to appear in bundles or on a sale.   2/5",-1,0,0
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,Worst implementation of a good concept EVER. I get it is suppossed to be a little clunky since you are fighting with melee weapons.

It is beyond clunky to down right rediculous levels. 1 swing 3 seconds even with the 'faster' charectors. Hit detection seems to be be based more on luck than any actual placement of your swing. blocking woudl be great if it reliably worked.

The good news is that the technical issues described in my original review (see below) have been fixed, though it took an unacceptably long time.  So now I can say that this is a pretty good and enjoyable game that I'd recommend to fans of the genre :)  CA can change this review to a positive one for only 2,49€. That's what they charged me for the blood and gore DLC.  -----------------------------  Original review:  Vsync doesn't work on nvidia hardware. Can't force vsync via control panel. Tripple buffered vsync in borderless mode doesn't work... yeah, that's right. It's like they took special care to break it. 2 dollar indie games get vsync right 99% of the time.  Their in-game vsync abomination makes the UI flicker badly. Yes, apparently this passed 'testing'.  I don't expect issues like this from full price releases. Most Early Access games aren't this amateurish.  This is Priorities Gone Wrong: The Game. They could spend cash on the Denuvo garbage, but it seems like they skipped QA entirely for the product they offer paying customers.

Think of Shogun 2's campain map. *Hero/Commanders are a one unit squad *Heroes can have mounts! * MAGIC ON THE BATTLEFIELD, BIG PLUS *Campain has alot of changes, This includes how tech works and political stuff *Special Units and different classes example: 'Big units' would be the Giant orges   I will add more stuff to this later on when I find new stuff.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is better than its predecessors but claiming it's 'Elder Scrolls with guns' is hyperbole at BEST. The game has a beautiful world, yet it's shallow and sparse--lacking true believability or detail. This leaves the player feeling empty and unmotivated; having no emotional attachment with the world or its characters--something one wouldn't expect from an open-ended world. Far Cry 3 takes place on an island that consists mostly of wilderness with a few small shanty villages and pirate outposts that you can 'liberate'. The game has some brief adrenaline-pumping sequences but it is ultimately a generic FPS through and through. Granted, it does have a light mixture of other elements like weapon customization, skill trees, and crafting. However these options don't make combat any less repetitive or the quests any less tedious. The story develops in traditional, albeit questionable ways and side missions and challenges are laughable and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game for $30 (which is what I paid for it). I would wait for a better deal. I know there are people out there who enjoyed Far Cry 3, but I'm not one of them.",-1,0,0

I could no longer feel happy, it was replaced with stress and games are supposed to be for fun.  Would I recommend this game?

Now that that's all done 'n' over with, on to da review!  Considering the ultra-shïtty game that was the previous installation in the FarCry series, namely FarCry 2, I was VERY negative towards FC3 when I started playing it. But lo and behold, it managed to not just turn me around 540 degrees, but also shove a 'LOVE ME OR DIE!' sign up my ärse. And after having a team of no less than four proctologists (butt-doctors, hurr durr) spend eight shifts each removing said sign, I was back to duke it out with the game again, and this time, I made it my personal li'l bïtch!  That right there might seem like inane, off-topic crap, but it's actually a pretty accurate analogy for how my actual gameplay experience was with FC3. I stumbled around like a complete fockin' rëtard at first, getting my äss handed to me by basically anything with a moderately bigger gun than me (which was everything), until I got my first few skills. Then, it was 'screw you, enemies, I've got STEALTH KILL POWER!' and away I went! I was a slicin', dicin', lean, mean, murder-machine, stalkin' the scene! So, yeah.  On a more serious note, the game has abso-bloody-lutely awful music, but that's 'tolerable' considering the fact that casing eject ports are for once on the right side on (most of) the guns (i.e. the ACTUALLY RIGHT SIDE!), the characters are SURPRISINGLY deep and interesting, the plot doesn't take 'no' for an answer when dealing with censoring and goes all-out nutbag fockery (literally, as the game has an actual sex-scene!) with blood, gore, swearing, booze, gambling, nudity and hell, even a fockload of drugs to boot! (That one bit with some funky fungal fun was plain awesome.)  There's not a Jagged Alliance 2-style epic amount of guns (which had upwards of a hundred freakin' guns methinks), but FC3 does have more than enough guns in almost every category (sans shotguns) to warrant a 'diversity's choice award', and the fact that it's almost completely free (except on certain missions) in how you play it, how you build your skills, it's absolutely knee-breakingly astounding how a game with a completely worthless predecessor like FarCry 2 could actually be GOOD, if not even GREAT. 8.7/10",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"EDIT: I have tried getting into it again, and I still see the problems listed here. It is also a fact that I hate F2P games, for it is often it is P2W.  Don't let Steam's Game Time fool ya'll. I've played this game since Nov 2013, daily. I got the game directly off SOE's page. When I first tried it, I felt confused in a good way, and It was fun. 100's of People on foot, in Tanks, In Transport Trucks 'Called Sunderers', And in fighters. Then after 2-3 Months, I felt like I was repeating yesterday, over and over. The first impressions the game left on me vanished. I decided to stay, however, seeing I invested time, and money. But then a few months later, I noticed a decline in player activity, something I honestly expected. It dropped to mere a continent having fewer them 50 people on it. At that point I felt like people left because of lack of content, lack of instructions, or lack of movitation. I then decided to quit my Membership, and leave the game all together.   Now, onto the Pros, and the Cons.  Pros: &gt; A lot of weapons and tools to use. &gt; A lot of so called 'Outfits' that are player groups. &gt; A good mix of Land, and Air vehicles to pilot. &gt; Big battlegrounds to exchange fire. &gt; Servers for different Time Zones.  Cons: &gt; Cosmetics and Membership are overpriced. &gt; Weapons with in-game currency are overpriced. &gt; Requires a High-Grade PC to run at decent settings. &gt; Poor Tuturial level. &gt; Poor In-Game Mic chat. &gt; Possible unexpected game crashes. &gt; Newer players can mess up a Base Capture-Defense  Thats all I was able to think of.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Ah, yes, Five Nights at Freddies. The most overrated horror game (Not sorry) in the history of horror games. To start off, I'd like to convey my disbelief that I actually had to BUY this game. As in exchange MONEY for it. It's about the least engaging game I've ever played. On top of that, it looks like a game that should be open to download and play for free rather than having to actually pay for it. That being said, it doesn stand out from its' indie game counterparts in several ways, like a Mexican immigrant standing among a group of US Army Rangers. Moving on...  As for the positives, there aren't too many. I suppose the most I can say about it is that it did, indeed, create a tense atmosphere and it certainly made me feel slightly anxious. The thought of strange, disturbing animatronic stalking you in a small building where you're powerless to fight back is something that the game recreated perfectly. Sometimes I even found myself turning around to check whether or not I was alone, so the game certainly knows how to create a nervous feeling for the player. That said, that still doesn't redeem it.  The level design is flat out...what's the word? Basic? Simple? Linear? It basically consists of several still images where the only change you'll see is Chuck.E Cheese popping onto the screen for a couple of seconds and then buggering off to his Child sex dungeon, before showing up again with a face that says 'I'm done down there, did you miss me?!' And that's why I had second thoughts buying the game. It seemed I needed to pay for more than the game was actually worth. '£5 worth of sitting around watching the Happy Tree Friends over here wander from room to room until one finally finds me and sinks his teeth into my manboobs? No thanks, Steam...' That's the problem with FNAF. It's TOO basic. The gameplay is boring, the level design is about as linear as an 80 tear old Man's ♥♥♥♥♥ and the only sense of horror you feel is when you see the animatornics, which only show up for a couple of seconds.  Then, we have the jumpscares themselves. I'm not even going to mention the huge leap in logic that a reinforced door required power to stay CLOSED. But here's my main problem with FNAF. The whole game exists for the premise of a jumpscare, which contradicts what a jumpscare is actually FOR. It's not just a punishment for losing the game, Scott, it's a climactic moment that is supposed to be built-up through atmosphere and tension. Although FNAF does a fantastic job of building up said tension, that feeling dissipates before the jumpscare actually happens. FNAF, like many other horror games nowadays, lacks pacing. That beautiful little trick that naturally builds up a beautiful amount of tension without even trying. When the jumpscare happens without warning, it does nothing but jolt the player awake, rather than actually scaring them.  So, do I recommend this game? Personally, no. I didn't find it to be particularly fun whatsoever, and found it less engaging than eating my own ♥♥♥♥. I suppose, if you just want to scream into a camera to rack up a large view-count on Youtube, this is the perfect game for you! Problem is, whereas FNAF considers itself a horror game, it's more of a point-and-click minigame with some horror-inspired elements. So, no. Personally, I'd say spend your money on something else...",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"It is difficult to recommend this game presently. When it works, it is enjoyable like so many other entries in the Total War series. However, I have encountered a game-breaking bug that has effectively prevented me from making ANY progress in campaigns beyond a certain point (normally around turn 70-90) in two of my three campaigns so far. Basically, the game decides to spawn the Chaos armies in a scripted event around turn 70-90, but if you're unlucky like me and so many other players, Chaos won't spawn and your game becomes bugged. At this point, you cannot end turn or move your units around the map. Nothing will fix the issue short of starting a new campaign, and seemingly there's nothing you can do to prevent it from happening, either. Thus, if and when the bug occurs, your campaign is borked and you've lost 10-15 hours of play. Given the hundreds of posts on the issue over the past month at the CA forums, Reddit, and the Steam group, I find it inexcusable for a company to let a bug of this magnitude slip and go unacknowledged until yesterday.  CA says they are 'looking into' this bug. However, if the fix doesn't retroactively apply to older campaigns, I'm done with this game and any future CA titles.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"This game is very unique, and downright terrifying.   I first found this game a few months ago when only the demo was available. I played it, and I had no idea what I getting myself into...  This game is terrifying, it's a point and click game but it has a crushingly terrifying atmosphere, because you could be jumpscared at any moment.   In this game, you play as a man who got himself a job at a kids pizza store named Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. You have been hired to work the night shift and you begin the game at Night 1. You cannot move in this game, you can only operate the door lights, peek up at your security cameras or shut/open your doors. You are unaware of the fact that the animatronics you are looking after (which are basically animal robots which are mascots to the store) actually move around at night, and if they find you...they will kill you.  You spend the five nights of this game constantly peeking up at the cameras making sure all of the animatronics are in place, and when they move you must keep track of them otherwise they will get into your office and horrifyingly jumpscare you.   That is basically how you survive in this game, you keep an eye on the animatronics and when they get near your office, you just shut the doors so they can't get in. Sounds pretty easy huh?  Well, these animatronics cut off your camera when they move around, which means that you have no idea where they are and they could have just ran straight next to your door without you knowing and get you. Also, if you're late catching them they will cut off the power to your doors, meaning certain death.   If that wasn't enough however, you have a power bar which means that you must be careful with the amount of power you use. (You lose power by looking at your camera, using the door lights and shutting the doors.) And once that percentage hits 0, you have only a matter of seconds to live before Freddy comes and finishes you off.   There are various ways you have to handle the animatronics in order to survive, and they all work differently but I am not going to tell you how to handle them because then the experience just won't the the same for you!   The jumpscares will make you jump, and will make you scream and it WILL happen so if you're going to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into!   The couple of negative things I could say about this game is that it does get tedious because once you know how to survive, that's it! That's it for the rest of the nights and you'll be safe, once you know the way around the game you will breeze through it. Another thing is that, after a certain amount of jumpscares; you do get used to them and they will not scare you so much, which does ruin the atmosphere a bit and may just frustrate you if you fail.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try and it will be challenge to complete all seven of the nights (yes, seven!) Just make sure you're prepared before going on this rollercoaster!",1,1,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"High skill ceiling with very simple controls. There isn't any other game with melee combat that gives you more direct control. Swinging feels weighted and satisfying. Every kill you get feels like you earned it. Combat is slow enough to let the player know exactly what's going on, but quick enough to feel frantic. You can be killed in an average of one to four hits, so every mistake you make feels like it's crushing. With all this, it's never unfair. It's easy to understand what you're doing wrong when you fail and what you did right when you succeed. It's that great balance and feedback you get from classics like Counter-Strike and Unreal Tournament.  The developers even provided free content patches, including additional game modes and maps. There is a plethora of modes to choose from, ranging from objective maps to free for all, even including a duel mode for those whose emphasis is on the competitive nature of the game.   The objective maps are interesting and unique but suffer from poor balance. Votekick is not hard to abuse if you get the server on your side. Some, but few weapons have balance issues in that they simply aren't as viable, despite being unique and fun.  Overall solid game and very much worth picking up at its current price, but this game is frequently on sale around $7.50.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"I don't know if Icefrog is still the head of developement in dota 2 but the gameplay has been deteriorating since its release. Every patch has something altered in the game instead of just fixing bugs. Old heroes who had the same skills for decades (since dota on Warcraft 3) have been changed and nerfed (Ex. Techie) while new imbalanced heroes are introduced into the game. The map has been completely changed in its first historical alteration in the last patch. They're attempting to bring in features from LoL. Dota 2 is losing more players to LoL. And it's a pity that they are willing to cut originality in order to keep a few douches.   The matchmaking and reporting system is horrendous. If you win a few games then you'll automatically be paired with losers. If you suck a few games, people randomly report you and you end up in the low priority pool. Which is pretty much a penalty. This happens often when you play alone with a four-man team.  It's been over 2-3 years since release and these issues have barely been addressed. They focus more on creating content so it drives money in. The gameplay and nerfing/buffing of heroes has deteriorated the once praised dota experience. It's not worth playing anymore. I know a lot of old school dota players from warcraft 3 that have avoided playing this version.",-1,0,0

Annoyed that the borderless window mode cannot be minimized, which resulted in a pain point as I configured my gamepad. Not enough checkpoints in the tutorial; Mess up a less and go back 2 or 3 lessons. Game crashes at maybe the halfway mark of the tutorial and I have to therefore start the entire tutorial mission over again; That is, the checkpoints don't even save so continuing... Isn't.

265930,Goat Simulator,"I wish I could give this more of a in-between rating, but unfortunately there isn't an option for that. But I guess overall, I have to say no.  It's meh. You get two hours of enjoyment out of it pretty much. I guess if you are absolutely bored and have nothing to do, it can pass some time since it doesn't really have a goal and you won't get sucked into it like other games, but can occupy you.  Most of it's charm comes from it's references. Those are pretty much where all the humor comes from. Sure the physics may be silly, but it feels like there isn't enough to play around with to get enough laughs.  The map is actually surprisingly small. I initially thought it would have more to do. You see a city in the backbround, but unfortunately, you can't got to it. That would have been a fun enviroment to play in, but unfortunately, it's just not part of the one map. Also, the developers put in houses that you CAN'T enter. There are only two houses you can enter: The one you spawn in front of, and the Coffee Stain Studios one. I just find it kind of stupid how you have a small map, and make it a tiny bit smaller by having useless un-enterable buildings.  It's also sucks how the civilians are pretty much another object. In a game like GTA, it's fun to wreck havoc because there is a whole bunch of people and you can go on a blood thirsty rampage and watch the civilians flee. Then cops show up and try to kill you and you then have even more people and things to blow up. The civilians here are kind of few, and they just don't do much. They may make screams, but they don't really run away all that much.  It also seems like it is a hog when it comes to CPU power. Unfortunately, I can't really say much on this, since I don't have a super expensive gaming rig, but apparently some people say they have a good gaming rig and they don't get as much framerate as they normally do. But still, I feel that hardly matters, since it seems like it's still playable even on my laptop, albeit it's on low settings.  I do like how the developers capitalize on the fact that it endorses bugs. That is funny to see at first, but when you get down to it, it kind of ruins the gameplay a bit. If you see a funny stretchy body bug in something like Fallout or Halo or Gears of War, or most other games, it's funny too see because that is an unintended result, and things are funny to us when we don't expect it. But, when you get those spazzy body physics in this game, you know that's what the game intends and it just isn't that funny.  It feels like this game is not worth 10$. Maybe more like 5$. But still, who knows. This game does have workshop, so maybe enough people can make fun and amusing maps to play on or some fun functions and features, and that can save this game. But of course, that is assuming that the people who are devent at making maps and what not don't get bored of this game to the point where they don't want to work on it anymore. But still, it doesn't matter so much to the developers. They already made a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money from this. It was advertised well and a lot of people boarded the hype train. I was one of the passengers. Now I am in a place I don't want to be and can't get my money back.  TL;DR It's only worth half it's price, and it seems to be lacking in a lot of areas. Meh physics. It sold well because of good advertising and hype. Can provide two hours of fun, and can possibly pass a short amount of time every so often if you need something to do or waiting for something.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,UDK.exe has stopped working!!!!  This isn't really an official review I just want to alert Torn banner studios to a problem that is around and a few people other than me also have. That after 4 hours of fun and awesome gameplay Chivalry now comes up with the message 'UDK.exe has stopped working'. Now this is really frustrating i mean i tried the usual: Uninstall then reinstall but of course that didn't work. Torn banner please fix. But for the 4 hours of fun that i had playing this game before it crashed. I am going to recommend it and I hope other players have fun playing this game just as long as it doesn't crash. :),1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"This is going to be a long review, if you want a synopsis of it, the game has an incredible battle system, smooth, and very well done. The biggest problem of it, are technicals, like high ping in some regions (South America for example), bad optimization, etc. BUT if you can afford those technicals issues, or if you have a friend to play it, then buy it when it's on discount.  Remember that this is based in my opinion, and i'm triying to be the most objetive possible, because i liked the game, but can't recommend this game because of the problems that i'm going to say.  Note: Even if i can't recommend it, i'm still going to play it, because the game is so funny to play, that i want to keep playing, that's it, even if i sound like an hypocritical.  If you want the long version, there you go:  First of all, i like the game, but i just can't recommend it to anyone that cannot afford those technical issues, since the game has A LOT of problems, like a high ping (At least if you're from south america), desbalanced team matchmaking, bad translation to spanish, a lot of bugs and more. But hey, the combat system of the game is incredible good, making 1 v 1 system very smooth and 'skill dependant' (You can parry, block, counter-attack, kick him in order to get through his shield, and has variations of attacks). All players have the same opportunities against the others, and only experience is which separate you from another player, because all weapons are balanced (In their own way, can't compare a Zweihander with a bow).  Conclusion: Chivalry is the perfect example of how technical issues can be so bad that can surpass all the in-game pros that it has.  Like i said earlier, if you like the game, ain't affected or can afford those technical issues (Like me), has a friend to play it with or just saw the the game at low price, then buy it.  If you doesn't meet at least two of these four 'points', then don't buy it (In my opinion) , in the other way, i highly recommend it.  Note: Remember that i pointed the game as 'not recommended' not as 'disliked' (Because if you read my review, you know that i'm still going to play this game. This is a really common missunderstanding when someone reviews a game in steam.",-1,0,0

But this does'nt really work for FPS.  What you expect is the best of the original Farcry back on tropical islands with superb eye watering graphics and some super FPS godlyness. Unfortunately what you get is a stupid RPG style which impeads the game and makes it such a slow paced crawler. This isn't helped by the very poor GUI menu system which you have to keep going in to back and forth.  That combined with, you can't play the game until you have installed and updated the Uplay software which delayed me for another hour and half as the ubisoft servers was so slow to download the data it required before allowing you to play the game. Steam launches Uplay and you just can't get around it without launching the poor software.  Positives: The graphics do look good and there is plenty of throw backs to the original Farcry landscape which is also very good.  Negatives: Uplay game launcher, Poor GUI Menu System, RPG styled game play which killed the game.",-1,0,0

It has faults and their price modeling for DLC is a huge ripoff but when it comes down to just vanilla gameplay it is a lot of fun to play regardless. Each of the factions is a lot of fun to play except for the Chaos who need some real tweaking to make fun. I've spent most of my time on The Empire and they are a lot of fun but have gaps in tiering up units due to almost all their units have secondary building requirements. Load times were extremely fast on SSD but had to move off their to make room for other things and it loads pretty slow on HDD. All in all like I said in the first sentence, yes the game is worth it but be prepared for the vomit of DLC that will be coming for months between $3-$20.",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Please not that this review is by no means a reflection of the game in general, but more for an overlying issue: the fact that it is not optimized for any Windows OS newer than Vista.  Unlike New Vegas, which basically uses the same engine, older BGS games like Oblivion and Morrowind, or even Interplay's Fallout games of 1, 2 and Tactics, Fallout 3 generally will not run correctly, if at all, on Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10. While select few have been able to make the game run just through Compatiblity mode, the overall majority of users require numerous steps to go over and hoops to jump through. And even then, if you are in the minority of those like myself, you can still find yourself unable to play even after jumping through the hoops.  While the avid modder for Bethesda games might find it normal and only slightly more frustrating, the average user might just find it to be one massive headache. And again, they might just find it a waste of time if, like myself, can't seem to get it to actually start up a new game even with things like FOSE (Fallout Script Extender), G4WL Disabler (Games For Windows Live Disabler), a 4GB Patch, and the Unofficial FO3 Patch.  If you are one of those users who actually wants to put in the effort and see about getting it working, then there is a guide located here:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=149946772   The Guide itself is simple to understand, easy to follow, and contains links to nessecary additions to help get the game running.  However, it by no means ensures the game will work. While you could find success in the early steps, you could just find yourself stuck with nothing solving it.   If you are truely desperate in playing Fallout 3 again, but don't want to deal with the hastle of the steps in the guide, or are in the minority of users that, like myself, can't get it to run even with the steps in the guide, then you have one of two options. If you are and avid PC player and might even want to mod it, then find a good quality PC that is running Windows Vista. Or, if you don't care about mods, how it looks, or even what platform you play it on, then go down to your local Gamestop/EB Games, or whatever the store is called for you and purchase a PS3 or Xbox 360/Xbox One (as it is a backwards compatible title) and Fallout 3 Game of the Year edition, as the console versions still work fine.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"This game was very disappointing to me. Despite my own decent computer and above average connection I found a lot of slowdown and delay in both the menus and even the game itself. The game looks nice, even on lower settings, but the audio is rather grating on the ears. The customization and weapon options for each class is a fun idea, however most new players will have to use the lackluster starter weapons before they can unlock anything decent though leveling. A lot of the menus feel very cluttered and are a pain to the eyes.  Gameplay overall feels very fun and satisfying when it works, but the game's hair thin hit detection takes a lot of time to figure out. New players should spend a lot of time practicing on thier own until they can figure out the hix box and controls for whatever class works best for them.   Community feels very non-existant at times. I often forgot I was actually playing with other people until I saw a few unique looking characters and even then it was insanely quiet. I'm sure it's full of decent people, but my expierence could be summed up when I saw a Knight t-bagging someone he just killed (to which he was promptly shot afterward).  Overall, I WANT to like this game, but the sloppy and sluggish menus, difficult gameplay, unsettling silence keeps it from meeting my hopes.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"A very well-made horror game with an interesting concept, where you can create your own strategy to survive through 5 nights (actually there is 7 nights) as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's pizza. Basically you're in a room with cameras and doors with lights to press if your enemies are outside the door beacuse you won't be able to see them very well in the darkness which will be a problem then... Your enemies by the way are 4 animatronic characters that will get more active the more progress you make on your nights... the first one is a bunny called: Bonnie. The second one is a chicken called: Chica... and the third one is a bear named Freddy (which is the main antagonist in the game) and the fourth one is a fox called: Foxy. they are going to try to kill you when they get a great chance and you have to stop these chances and survive through the nights... but be aware of the power you have to left side in the bottom corner... if it runs out you will die... possibly... or maybe if you're lucky you can actually make it to the next night... oh i forgot to mention: you have to work your shifts from 12 am to 6 am in the game... and the only help you get is from a guy on the phone, cameras and the doors that can be closed to stop them from coming in... sometimes you can't close the doors that means that you're doomed... because one of them is in your room and will kill you if you put up and then down the camera... You have to watch every one of them on the camera to make sure they don't move so often... but more necessary... only check on Freddy and Foxy... beacause those two are the actual problems in this game... because they can kill you very easily if you don't check on them too often... but you need to be aware of the other two too: Bonnie and Chica... but Bonnie is more active than Chica is... so you don't need to check on Chica too much... but then there are the other two... or actually THE THREE problems: Bonnie, Freddy and Foxy that you need to guard (you can hear Bonnie and Chica step on the floor outside the room sometimes that means that they might or might not be very close to you) ... I highly recommend this game for those who wants to get their socks scared off &gt;:) If you don't find animals scary... Five Nights at Freddy's will prove what kind of hell animals can be...   PS: there is a fifth animal called: Golden Freddy... and he can be found in your office if you look on the cameras on a poster in one room too much... and if you stare on him too much he will crash your game and end the attempt you're doing in this game... so get rid of him by going back to the cameras, because then he'll disappear...",1,0,1

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Clicker Heroes is a fun, laid back game, but in my opinion, quite generic. Allow me to explain.  When I say generic, it doesn't really bring anything NEW to the table. Like most other clicker games, it's 'Spam your mouse button, buy some auto-clickers, boom bada bam.' Which I'll admit, kind of disappoints me. Now I know that's sort of the point of clicker games, but I would rather spend an hour on a game I like instead of 5 minutes each day, getting on to upgrade a few things and then waiting tomorrow for more currency.  I will admit however that clicker heroes does have its pros. A level system, where you'll fight stronger monsters as you continue through them. It's got a sort of storyline once you piece together the character's little backstories, you can sort of see how they connect to one another, which I always enjoy a good read. Other games like cookie clicker and adventure capatlist don't really have much insight or backstory.  In any case, I do recommend this game for when you're bored and/or have a few minutes to spare and can just drop by and see how everything is going. It's a good game for a laid-back and patient person.  7/10 Pop-tarts. A bit generic, but still has it's own uniquness.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Pros: framerate, cool fantasy stuff, magic, cowmen that throws giant boulders and stomps litle things to dusty death. No Hun's. Cons: Cities are basically walls with fancy backscreen. Water is useless, trading is scarce, resources are only intresting in regard of recruiting and building. No depth. Lack of content. Simply not enough factions. Too pricy.   Maybe worth 20€, if you love warhammer. The best bit's costs 17€ extra, wich should have been included in retail.  You'll end up at almost 100€ with DLC's and still it feels pretty scarce compared to Rome 2 or Attila. I do like the atmosphere and playable heroes/agents during battle. Also the skill-tree is neat.  It give's me as the commander a feel to be more entwined with my domains and the battles fought. Some heroes are specced and used similarly to agents in other games of the franchise. But it's those heroes specced and honed in battle that makes these new mechanics shine, and they shine bright. Charge in with your faction leader or hero of your lands and obliterate enemy units, boosting morale of your own men. It's really good.  But.  When the new features start to settle in on the player, one realises new features are scarce. In addition some old features from the franchise are nowhere to be found. The first battles and conquests are immersive, it engulfs you as the player into the world of Warhammer.  However, when the battle cries start to echo out into the 'vast' lands and the fog of war finds its escape back into the darkness.   I get this feeling of, this was it.   There is nothing really that motivates expansion except for more armies and bigger battles. It's just the same over and over. Nothing motivates further progress. The world starts to feel shallow and those mechanics and feeling of creating a legacy in the fantastic game Attila is simpy not there.  This is pretty much an expansion with Warhammer map and units. It's is cool and all for us that likes fantasy books and games. But its just too shallow. After a few hours, It's like waking up hungover next to a stranger savage orch.  I constantly find myself playing Attila instead, drafting mighty battles with endless variation due to mods, or simply rewriting history. Trying to marry my persian daughter to the Huns, playing coop with a friend slowly spreading the only true religion for world domination. Launching a mighty offensive to make England pagan again. I conquer fertile lands to farm, investing vast ammounts of gold into science and philosophy, for my people. Because i care.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"Good game with worst system rules ever made. The report system is broken and developers knows about it, just not doing anything about it. For example CSGO. If you get reported, you will go to the overwatch when casual players determine if you were behaving bad or cheating. If not, you are without penalty. If they think you were cheating you will get VAC control. If VAC finds anything you will get banned. So basicaly, there is someone in real life that sees the play yoou were reported in. But in DotA2, if someone report you for whatever reason they choose you will get punished even if you were innocent.  For example, you want to play some hero and even showed and told the team before they made the move, they ignore you and then flame you for picking the hero anyway.. You may try your best, but since 98% ppl are under 110IQ (its truth) and they dont get what they are doing or even worse, that they are maybe wrong, they will report you for, lets say griefing. Since 98% are not that smart, this will happen TOO offen. And the result? You will get lower priority game.. EVEN after you WON the game for the ones that reported you.. Make sense? No. So, if you love DotA, you may try go back to old DotA game (W3 version).   And I will not write here about racist Russians, whos picking EU servers and yet not respecting the language.

The starting gear is competive with the 'high level gear', so its depends more on skill than just buying the best weapons. Good game.",1,0,1

It's just numbers going up to make other numbers go down. I have never seen a game that gave me less of a sense of just how big a billion is. I can't put it down. If I can get my damage to go from 15,544s to around 300S, I can tackle the next boss.

This is, by far, the most unbalanced, most new-user-unfriendly, un-fun pile of garbage I have ever played. Not only is its one goal to basically force you into buying their worthless microtransactions, but it also punishes you for trying to use hard work to upgrade your own stuff to at least match the unstoppable warlords you constantly face. Teamwork is made useless by invincible vehicles that cannot be harmed, and even if you do win it's because you had more vehicles or Max classes than the other enemy. What are Maxes? They're basically a purchasable class with so much armor and weaponry that shooting at one is like trying to dig a hole through prison with your bare hands.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"In terms oF game design this game is fine. The implementation, however, is garbage. Characters routinely warp into kills due to poor handling of latency. Terrible animations that look as if they're missing frames. It's often impossible to time blocks because your opponent will just warp through their animations. Heaviest class has the fastest strike. Certain classes, like Man of Arms, is damn near useless. Fists are one of the weakest yet slowest weapons in the game. Swords cut through multiple people with no decrease in damage (even with the first opponent hit does not die). You get stuck on people constantly because the characters don't slide along each other completely ♥♥♥♥ing up dodges and other manuvers when teammates are around.  General overall crappy feel to combat system. I would like to see someone make a similar medieval FPS with a technically competent melee system.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"If you have the chance to buy this game and it's on sale(I say this cause we all need to save money), DO SO. People have compared it to Skyrim with guns, and I can see where someone might get this impression but I would compare it like this: 25% Skyrim and 75% Assassin's creed. Yes, you have skills, and yes you have crafting but the crafting is more like Assassin's creed. 'Collect 2 Alligator hides to create the extended holster' '2 Yellow plants for the hunting syringe' ect, you get the idea. And for this game, it's not really a bad thing. I guess for me, I'd prefer the crafting like Skyrim rather than AC. BUT that's just me... You can capture Outposts(which is really fun, by the way. Id kinda like more like this) to open up fast travel points and stores to purchase weapons and ammo. Hunting is rather fun but once you have all the materials to craft what you need, theres no more need to hunt.  Skill are set up very nicely and are displayed in the form of your tatau(tattoo) on your arm which is a REALLY cool way to do it. I hope they do something like this in the next game.  Vaas....BEST VILLIAN EVER...If I was gay, I'd have a crush on him...who I am I kidding...I'M STRAIGHT AND I HAVE A MANCRUSH ON VASS...TOTALLY NOT IN A GAY WAY, THOUGH.

When I mean 'interacted' with, I mean smashing, blasting, headbutting and... licking. Plenty of hidden things and locations to find and it's a lot of fun just how crazy it can get.  Downside? Very graphics intensive. As my comp isn't top of the line, I have to set everything at the minimum and it still lags abysmally if I have the camera angle high enough to see far.   Good and bad at the same time. The game is easily broken. Getting the Demon Goat form and having the mutator of 'Goatborn' (which is a wonderful effect, I must say) at the same time causes the goat to so 'super silly-putty' and spaz out all over the place.

It is taking me(and still is!) that long to actually start it up. ♥♥♥♥ I am sick of starting a game and having it crash.  UPDATE: Woo, got it on console. I won't comment about bugs or anything, only other problems. This game is overrated as ♥♥♥♥. The storyline is unoriginal and flat, the lore is a complete mess ,and it is very tedious. Wanna repair your gun? Oh sorry wait until your repair is level 100 to repair it all the way which even then takes new weapons. The gameplay is basically like a dumbed down version of oblivion. Except this one is very forgiving, the main quest is very short, and the whole karma is stupid. Just nuked a village full of people? You will be forgiven if you do the main storyline the 'good' way. The DLC's are ok, I guess. The only ones worth getting are Mothership and The pitt. For the open world is either a plain landscape or DC, which I guess is ok.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout become a part of my life back in 2008 when I found this game through my brother. He lended me the game about 7 years ago, but he's never getting it back. Here's why: Fallout 3 is one of those games you will never truly forget. Of course, I cannot be totally biased in this review since I'm absolutely obsessed with this game, but I really really really recommend you play this ASAP.  Pros of this game- I absolutely love the location of Fallout 3 (Mainly washington D.C.) because throughout the quests we learn pieces of the United States' history which is absolutely awesome to me. Also not to mention the incredible sountrack that you can listen to while venturing out into the cold Wasteland.  The characters in this game are heartfelt, funny, and all around just enjoyable to meet. Each character has their story to learn about, and some hilarious side quests.  V.A.T.S. V.A.T.S. V.A.T.S.!  Perks! I think the perks in this game are pretty sweet, and I absolutely adore them.  DLC! While some of the DLC was pretty boring or not necessary, I believe that most of the DLC was very intresting and difficult.  The story was one of the best stories I have played because the whole aspect of losing your father, and going on a wild goose chase for him is so interesting to me. I felt so many waves of emotion while playing Fallout 3's story.  Cons of this game-  Combat is definitely not the best in this game, so if you think that's extremely important then you may not like this game too much. Graphics are pretty low quality in this game, but what can you expect? It was made in 2008, so you have to keep that in consideration. Although I do wish they were a bit better.  Glitches, glitches, glitches galore.  Anyways I hope you have the amazing chance of playing Fallout 3 without knowing much about it because it is an incredibly fun game to get in to, and I believe you will love it. Thanks and happy trails! :)",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I have been a Total War fan since the first Rome, I've played Rome 1&amp;2, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 and this has to be the worst of the lot. I am also abit of a Warhammer fan, but not hugely, so I was really excited to get a Warhammer based fantasy Total War. I have to say I am very disapointed.  The game frankly doesn't feel anywhere near finished as it is, core content/races have been cut out to be sold as DLC which is a discusting practice that needs to stop. I remember when unlocking new races in a Total War game was a massive insentive to finish the campaign and play again, now you have to buy it, it's a joke.  The download size was shockingly small, about 11GB, compared to 25GB of Rome 2 and 20GB of Shogun 2 and when you play the game for a few hours you see why, the campaign map isn't very big, and each region only seems to have 1 battle map, so you end up fighting battles on the same handful of unimaginative and fairly empty maps.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I'm going to try to be as honest as I can with you. Its a great FPS, if you are NR. Its a great tank game, if you are the purple F***s. Its a bad day to be TR if you don't have at least 100 kids with you. With that being said, it shows factions are super inbalanced. NR is always going to hit harder than TR, so TR gets tanks, then the purple kids completely destroy you because they are just better. Aircrafts are the most overpowered thing in the game, and I don't actually think someone can just balance that. But the worst part, the upgrades. It is a pay to win game. It takes a very very very long time to buy a gun, and with the starting guns, you will take about a 5 day grind.   However, it does have its fun, for about a week.",-1,0,0
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I used to love this game, I really did. I got it a year or two ago and thought it was the best thing I'd ever played. I've been playing it at an average pace since then. I've learned how to drag and feint and all the other exploits and I had a blast.   Then I realized that this game has gone to crap.  The devs have only been releasing skins and items in all the recent updates, and everytime they say they fixed a bug, another 4 pop up. All the combat needs a revision, because I can see an arrow fly above my head, a second passes and then I get killed by it even though it was 10 feet above my sorry ♥♥♥ skull, and people can cut through shields like they were cardboard.   The buttons don't work and the menus are screwed up. And don't get me started on how unfair this game is to new players. All the veterens that have played since the game has come out are at least a rank 30. Being a Intermediate-High rank character myself (I'm around 33 or something like that) I've learned all the combat stuffs and can hold my own against even the most skilled drag queens and feinting goats. Then I realized, I'm one of them now. I had to become one to beat them, I am ashamed of myself for switching to the dark side of the community and exploiting the animation system and hitboxes. 'Dragging' is when a player turns his mouse to a side to either speed up or slow down the swing of the blade and feinting is a game mechanic in which you can cancel an attack by hitting a button.  If you want a game where you will get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by unfair odds, buy DarkSouls or Bloodborne or something. This game is turning into another hat simulator. If you want a game where you have to buy everything to be respected, get TF2 or CS:GO, at least those Dev's still patch the game and try to work with the community. The devs have gotten lazy and greedy. All the updates are just adding items from the workshop as weapon reskins and hats. Rather than trying to revise the things that need revision desperately, they'll release a community made map, or fix a bug where the 3rd bolt of the Mason Knight's right shoe didn't show up properly. Basically, they only release useless or redundent patches.  At this point the game can only get better or get much worse, check it out in a year or two and maybe they'll have fixed things, If not, then this game will live on in the hearts of the veterens and die out. If you really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to get it; do so while it is on sale or when it does another one of it's crossovers with another game, just try to be patient after you've been kicked off of the newbie servers  6/10- Used to be fun, still is at times, good combat if you never encounter Drag queens and feinters, Great fun for Veterens but no fun for new players, unfortunately has begun it's journey to the dark side of Gaming  Pros: +Fun +High potential +Best Medieval combat I've seen  Cons: -Lazy/Greedy Devs -Easially exploited systems -Bug ridden and sub-par maintenance -Lack of attention to where it is really needed by Devs",-1,0,0
570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, the game was officially released on July 9, 2013 as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. In most regions, Dota 2 is exclusively available through Valve's content delivery platform, Steam. Each match of Dota 2 involves two teams, both containing five players and occupying a fortified stronghold at either end of the map. Victory is achieved by destroying the enemy's Ancient, which is invulnerable until certain objectives are achieved. Each player controls a 'Hero' character and focuses on leveling up, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory during each match. Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, with the hiring of DotA developer 'IceFrog' to serve as the sequel's lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded it for remaining faithful to its predecessor while also increasing the level of production quality, as well as for its engaging and rewarding gameplay experience. However, Dota 2 was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. The game has become the most played on Steam, with daily peaks of over 550,000 concurrent players.",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"To put this game into perspective, it is like a super-sized Battlefield 2142 with a three-way conflict and a seemingly limitless supply of respawn tickets. Customizable weapons, vehicles, and loadouts allow for players to adjust their gear to suit their needs, whether it would be to quickly repair and deal massive amounts of human tissue damage, or to have the long reach of a good sniper rifle to precisely remove HVTs (High-Value Targets), or to fly high and drop slowly down over a wall, where the enemy least expects opposition, or hook their team up with plenty of ammuntion to keep them in the fight. There are many other varieties of loadout that I could not hope to cover here.  This game is not infantry-centric, either. Players have their choice to drive their land vehicles or fly high in various VTOL aircraft, all of which with varying sizes and forms of firepower. An offensive push with a mix of LAV (Light Armored Vehicle) and MBT (Main Battle Tank) could force an enemy frontline to back off and retreat. Air strikes and air support would give a team a high angle of attack to rain death on the enemy forces.  A player can be dangerous, when fighting solo and trying to be a one-person-army. Fighting with a team, however, is deadly. This game can appeal to the officers and leaders of the real world, as well. Coordinating a team and leading them to victory, crushing the less-coordinated enemy force in the process, is a rewarding experience, too.  If you happen to be reading this, and Battlefield was a game you enjoyed playing (like me), you should definitely try Planetside 2. It may surprise you.",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"This game is not good. I very much want to like this game, but i just can't. Heres a collection of reasons why:  1: The story is crap. It's not engaging whatsoever, and its not even your story. You're just a tag-along most of the time, and even when you aren't you still never really feel like you are accomplishing anything.  2: You have no real choice in playstyle. You either shoot things, hit things, or blow things up. Thats it. No pacifist runs. This wouldn't be too big an issue if this was fun, but...  3: Combat is boring, just horribly boring. None of the weapons really pack any kind of punch, and in the end it just feels like you're shooting spitballs for all the balistic impact the weapons have. The melee weapons fare slightly better in this regard, but with exeption of a few lategame and unique weapons they just all feel the same; just with different damage numbers.  4: It looks like ♥♥♥♥. Now, I don't have anything against dated graphics, but the textures are just plain bad on a lot of things, at times worse than oblivion, and definetly worse than New Vegas, which is on the same engine. The omnipresent gray-green filter does not help this any.  5: The AI is terrible. Running into walls, spazing out, not reacting to being shot, the works.  6: It crashes a lot. These crashes are unavoidable in most cases, and can only be delayed by installing some unoficial patches and such.  7: The DLC. Its not great. Out of all of the DLC, only Point Lookout is really worth playing, and to a lesser extent The Pit.  Get Fallout: New Vegas instead. It is everything that this game should have been: Fun.",-1,0,0

265930,Goat Simulator,"This game seems as if it would be fun for its 'so bad it's good' nature, and there are perhaps moments of enjoyment which can be brought forth from experiencing the zaniness within. However, the central gimmick this game relies on, being a purposefully broken, buggy game, falls short of being anything more than a mere novelty worthy of no more than a brief period of attention.  The ultimate problem comes not with the joke becoming old fast, however, though that is still a problem. The real problem is the lack of truly having anything to do. In this game, you can wander around and headbutt things and lick things and maybe use an item or two found around the world you wander through. Every once in a while you may discover some new ability, but the abilities don't refresh any replay value the game could've had since the abilities are typically something like becoming stronger, a feat which is entertaining for approximately two seconds.  Besides lacking in meaningful character advancement, the other central problem is the size of the worlds you occupy. I've not played the DLC (and I'd rather not bother), but the overall size of the base game is quite minuscule, as if even the developers were unsure of how they could keep a game like this interesting enough for so long without adding some new tacky, inane gimmick in their DLC. It's small even for ten dollars (thankfully I paid far less), so I don't recommend, if you dare bother, picking this up for that price.  This game is a clear case of 'it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.' People lapped it up easily due to the 'so bad it's good' label anyway, what with this game becoming easy fodder for people on YouTube to flail about like goons while they giggle and chort over the most mundane occurences within the game. This game, more than anything, readily showcases a major problem within video games, the dumbing down of content and willingness to accept ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game is not the worst I've played, since I will give it some slack for at least trying to some extent, but I still would strongly consider this a candidate as one of the worst video games ever.",-1,0,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"A good casual game to sit and play for 10 to 15 minutes before or after work. Then after you become a little more powerful you get stuck at doing only up to level 160-170 for about 1 month. Before this game came to Steam and was only a flash game on the internet, with 100-150 souls you could reach level 180 with no problem and with 150+ souls you can do up to level 200+. Now, you play for a week or two, get to 100/200 souls and you can reach level 130-160 with no problem. BUT after that comes the mega-uber-never-seen-before farming. I had 300 souls and I can barely reach level 170-180 level. Unless you give a lot of real money for this crappy game, then you will have to farm for the rest of your life. Oh... and at some point you will see that this game won't be so casual, you will sit for 10 minutes, but you will see that, that won't be enough at some point, the game forces you to waste up to 40-45 minutes of your time and probably even more as you progress. I do NOT think this game even deserves to be on Steam, but that's my opinion. In any case I do NOT recommend this game. It's a HUGE waste of your lifespan, believe me I lost somewhere around 30 hours(the 70 hours you see are because I've been AFK for over 30 hours) in this game. Believe me it isn't worth your time!

570,Dota 2,"Absolutely horrible game that will move any rational, grown person to instantly leave solely because of how terrible the game community is. This game is plagued by 12-16 year olds like League of Legends, and in almost every match you'll find yourself getting angry because you are teamed with kiddies who only care about themselves getting a good score, and not about winning the actual match.  The worst encounters are those where you are matched with a group of kids who will do anything to blame you because 'lel its funny xDDDD' and because 'ura bad omg dude y u no gief me rune?? :(((('  The worst is this pro-feminism, pro-'racial mixing' that Steam is forcing upon its mindless consumers.  If you do not submit yourself to 'le cool gurl gaimer xDDDD' on your team then you're a sexist and 'omg ban dis guy omg he offen me :(((,' and if you call those poor Asians or Africans for a word that describes them, then you're a racist and 'omg ura a racist omg ban dis guy :((('  So, let's recap: Community consists largely of 12-16 year old 'cool' gamers. Players are often so challenged that they are incapable of seeing what's in their best self-interest. Not submitting yourself to inferior players (female, autistic, etc.) means you're a bad person and Gayben is personally going to punish you for not agreeing with The New Standards that Steam is enforcing upon people.",-1,0,0

However it comes at a price.  Ultra-Freemium, 9 euros a month premium, with individual items costing from 5 to 20 euros. The cop-out for such ridiculous pricing across their entire range is: you don't have to buy, nobody is forcing you.  The game falls under P2C-up (Pay-2-Catch-up), the most insidious form of P2W (Pay-2-Win). Imagine playing your standard MMO-RPG, such as wow, where instead of playing/grinding for the items you need, you can hand over 60 euros and get all your gear. This Planetside 2's business model.

When I heard about this I was honestly really excited, I pictured MASSIVE wars, from a developer that hopefully cared about Warhammer the same as many Warhammer fans do. What I instead seen was a company that is well known for ♥♥♥♥ing over it's own fanbase, doing the same thing to the Warhammer fanbase.   Warhammer has a lot of love, and a lot of extremely loyal fans (to a fault at times) and the amount of love this has gotten from a lot of Warhammer fans has to do with that.   The fact it's a Warhammer game shouldn't mean we look over the greed of the company that made it.   I honestly hate this game, be it their absolutely pathetic DLC's, that all together are $40+ ontop of the $72 for the base game. The fact the game almost seems unfinished in a lot of areas, and how most of it seems blocked behind Downloadable Content. The fact that the Campaign for each race is pretty much the exact same, the obvious lack of content, and the over-hype.  (Not done yet)   The fact they refuse to release the modeling tools, or really help out the modders at all - The mod compatability being the greatest feature due to all the mods being done by _Fans_ that _Love_ Warhammer. The fact that they instead of making new factions with reasonable prices, opting instead to sell blood packs, release units like the Blood Knights, ones that are inferior compared to a mod creators version.   Basically the game is abhorrent to MANY fans of Warhammer. And hell - even many fans of Total War.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody, nevermind a fan of either franchise.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER," Summary:  A solid if somewhat unambitious addition to the TW series geared more towards new players.  Pros:  Well balanced, stable, a few new innovations.  Cons:  Many elements stripped down or removed from previous installments, suffers from TW's perennial issues of neurotic AI and an unbalanced endgame.  I've had a long, tumultuous relationship with the Total War series. From the processor melting release of Medieval II to the glory days of Shogun 2 I've stuck with it. After Rome II I swore I'd never buy one of their products at anything above bargain bin price, but like the siren song of Chaos I've fallen for Creative Assembly's wiles again and shelled out for my release week copy. Well, surprise surprise. I'm disappointed.  On the plus side, CA does seem to be learning from their mistakes. After the hot mess that was Rome II's release the team reigned in their ambitions and settled on a smaller, tighter experience. Siege attacks focus on a single wall 'segment', most unit armor and weapon upgrades have been jettisoned, and diplomacy has been whittled down to its barest essentials just to name a few areas they've put the screws to.  That's not to say there aren't real improvements here. A lot of the changes seem designed to shake up the samey game of 'smash your armored infantry blob into the enemy's face until their morale breaks' so many TW fights fall into. Magic has been added giving generals more offensive heft and lending more nuance to heroic abilities beyond simply spamming your buff buttons the second they recharge. Under the hood physics tweaks have drastically improved cavalry as well. Instead of stopping the moment they so much as tap an enemy horses will now plow into formations, or if the target is unfortunate enough to be loosely packed carve straight through them. Finally agents have been overhauled and can now fight in combat alongside your armies as little mini generals. I feel like CA really hit the mark on this one. They're strong and versatile enough to justify their presence in an army but not so overpowered that you would necessarily choose them over a good combat unit.  The problem is that even all that polish isn't enough to distract me from the essential truth. This is just another Total War game, with all the same issues that have plagued previous installments. Attempts to balance TW's old bugaboo of siege battles did make things more fair, but only barely and at the cost of some of the game's coolest looking set pieces. The AI is back to its old antics, attacking when it has no chance of winning and meandering around when it could. The endgame is similarly uneven. Depending where you are on the map the chaos invasion can be an existential threat or a positive benefit. I've had games where I was gearing up for the final epic confrontation only to find that the Imperials had already killed the chaos anti-christ and were well on their way to building tailoring workshops in hell. I mean it's nice to see that my allies had their ♥♥♥♥ together, but I was under the impression my attention was urgently required.  So all in all? It's progress. CA at least seem to be aware of the series' flaws and taken steps to fix them, even if it was a sort of stumbling half shuffle. If you're new to the Total War series and are looking for something to cut your teeth on Warhammer is a fine enough place to start. Likewise if you're a veteran TW player interested in the warhammer universe the borrowed concepts give a fresh enough buff to keep you interested for at least a playthrough or two. No doubt more DLC is already on the way, and in time Warhammer might be a truly worthwhile addition to the series, but I fear all that will be too little, too late.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: Warhammer  What a game! I just finished winning the Empire Campaign and I have to say this was quite the experience.   PROS:   Graphics are amazing! Unit diversity is really cool for a TW game. The heroes are fun and also makes it quite frustrating when you lose one because there's a huge time investment there. The Lords are similar as above but can totally change the tide of a combat. The action was fast paced for this type of game. I was being attacked in four different directions all over the map. I had no bugs in my entire playthrough. The music was a good compliment to the action. The items on your heroes are very unique and can turn the tide of a battle. It's definitely worth doing the item quests. The battles are really fun and have a lot of great tactics and detail, but by turn 150+ you will mostly auto-resolve.  CONS:  It's VERY hard to get more than 5-6 large armies. The mechanics of the game are limiting in that way, which makes it hard to defend against the Chaos from up North West, North, and North East and the Greenskins and Vampire Counts from the South. I had almost every settlement maxed out to give me gold and it was still hard fielding 6 armies. The long campagin win is longggggggggggggggg. The tech trees make it very difficult to make everything in one province. It would be nice if some of the smaller cities could go up to Level 4 at least--especially in Reiksland.  Summary:  If you like Total War, this is a great game for you. If you like Warhammer, this is a great game for you.

I was not disappointed.   Each race has a different playstyle, although they are all similar enough to be playable without relearning the game each time.  My only slight gripe is the battle AI: As long as it is out of missile range, it WILL just sit there and wiggle its fingers at you, unless you are playing a quest battle where it has been pre-programmed to attack you. The instant you move into missile range, your army gets bum-rushed. I always bring Artillery to assist the AI's decision making here.  My favourite feature, out of all of them, and including flying units, is the ability to individually name units. It allows anything from creating a regiment that your troops belong to, to giving an individual name to a monster or single unit. In one campaign, I named my steam tanks individually.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"Pure garbage and a bore. Warcraft III custom games were designed by amateurs who had no idea how to engage the player. Any game banking on its 'team aspects' is bound to be mediocre. Warcraft III is a vastly superior team game that allows for a greater level of flexibility and leeway for individial players. The result is that good players dictate the matchup in ways that is impossible in dotA and mediocre players are still engaged without being discouraged. Fixation on exacting teamplay to the minutest detail is NOT indicative of a good team-game. Looking through the negative 'reviews' attests to exactly what this leads to: A ♥♥♥♥-poor community. DotA does away the RTS skillset and variation of Warcraft III while maintaing the RTS interface. It does not compensate its deficiencies by offering something new in return. Rather it fixates on the most mundane of systems: hero builds and exacting teamplay, and in addition a contradictory ruleset.  -5/10",-1,0,0

And once things start slowing down, you can trigger an ascension to restart from level 1 with the various bonuses you have gathered to carry over.  To summarize: train heroes, kill monsters, gather gold, and then rinse and repeat. Pop in the occasional ascension/ancient/mercenary to speed things up.

I even turned down my graphic settings to reduce the visual vomit and get 20 fps. Even Marathon and Doom from the 90s had better graphics and were a lot more fun. This game is probably the worst FPS ever. I wasted 5 hours of my life that I can't get back. I will uninstall the game so it won't waste hard drive space too.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Originally posted on a different game by mistake (Note to self: Don't post reviews while extremely tired.)  Pegs my four-core 3 GHz system, runs at 3-15 FPS with GTX 780 @ 1920x1200, looks a few years old. Vast barren landscapes with equally spaced 'facilities' that have functional-sounding names but do nothing. Weapon and tech descriptions dry to make everything sound advanced and powerful...even the starter gear that's rubbish.  Beginner sniper scope and first upgrade provide no noticeable zoom compared to bare naked Mk I Eyeball; I can see farther by angling the game camera so that what I want to zoom in on is at the edge of my screen than I can by looking directly at it with or without scope. By the time you're close enough that your vision isn't obscured by the distance fog and your shots have a statistically significant chance of hitting, you're in plain site to enemies--and at such low framerates, that's your life expectancy.  You spend most of the time waiting to respawn, or else deliberately seeking the areas with the fewest combatants so you have a chance of jumping some other poor schmuck who's wandering between stations.   Battles are furious...and meaningless, because whatever you lose one hour you'll probably hold again another hour. There's no benefit to capturing a whole continent aside from a notice that your faction of the moment took it; seemed like the game would just reset ownership to random after a while to keep the 'infinite war' going.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I have been playing Chiv on and off from free weekends since the game came out in 2012. I've owned the game for about a year now after picking it up from a sale when it was like $2 so I've gotten the chance to play with essentially every combination of class, weapon, and map. When the game first came out it was a ton of fun; easy to play, but hard to master.   Unfortunately, the game play has devolved from having correctly time strikes into people cranking their sensitivity all the way up, spamming a combo button and throwing their mouse around while jumping and crouching. This wouldn't be a huge if Torn Banner Studios wasn't a smaller developer. The animations are not very well done which makes the cheesy way people play almost impossible to fight against as a player will attack behind themselves while their character, and more importantly, weapon face an entirely different direction. Most of the time when someone complains about it in-game they complain of lag, but it isn't. It's poor animations being exploited by an exploited combat system.  Additionally, when I first started playing the game the weapon stats listed in-game actually meant something and now those little bar graphs seem to be meaningless. Do you like playing first-person precision fighting games where every enemy no matter what weapon they're using or you're using (regardless of whether you block, parry, or stun-block them with a kick) can attack you faster? Then this game is for you! Seriously though, it seems like the only way to kill anyone is the gang up on them which is another thing I see people griping on in reviews. Plus, it is super apparent the maps were not fully tested as just about every piece of collideable environment will get your player character trapped and killed because the skeletal mesh can't walk over a pebble on the ground.  All in all the game is still really fun, it looks cool, and it's one of the few good options in an under saturated market. All this being said, you should definitely not pay for full price and the DLC is ludicrous. However, it is definitely worth a dollar or two during big steam sales.",-1,0,0

Can you fix the community? Give them something harsh punishment This kind of things are just like cyberbullying.. Made someone depressed I know I know it's just a 'game' right? But you can see the effects for the people They're unleashing negative energy to other people so they can unleash it to other people again until this community became the most Toxic community  I mean seriously 10 years ago, DotA community just not that bad.. It's friendly in fact! Maybe it's because everyone's learning? And trying to learn together is fun?

Can't you at least give some attention to your games? I know Valve can't count until 3, so this will be the last game At least make it a good memory for all the players  Here's a very simple thing for example, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD 'Thank you' truly from their heart? Thank you for supporting us Thank you for carrying us Thank you for hanging in there Thank you for handling the mid nicely Thank you for buying us wards &amp; courier Thank you for teaching me where I did wrong Or something like It's ok everyone's fail at one time Not everyone's perfect You're doing a good job!

At least more enjoyable to play.. right?

I say this since the game did a total 180 in quality within those hours. The game went from completely unplayable to a very smooth and enjoyable experience. I'm not sure if a majority of people are having the same experience as me now, but if they are then the game is totally worth it.  At first, I was worried that I had completely wasted my money on this, the same feeling of being burnt when ROME 2 had launched a few years back.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,In my hours of playing i can say the game is overal fun and good for a few laughs but then becomes very frustraiting when there is always the one player that wants to consantly show off and ruin the experience for everyone when you are just trying to have a normal game some of the weapons are pretty rediculous in terms of swinging and stabbing the drag system makes the game interesting but it only increases the difficulty for other players who aren't used to it causing people to lose interest in the game when they are constantly being killed by flips and spins by rude players who just want to show off cause they can the community makes me sick and i wouldnt reccomend the game unless you want to become a person who just sits and is a constant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the game abusing the drag system because he can be and no one will do nothing because no one cares people are inconsiderate of how this makes the community feel and it ruins peoples fun for the game this game is Decent but it needs an overhaul of the swinging and drag system so that it feels smoother because breaking my spine at Very high senstivity rates and reverse overhand mauling people doesn't really fit well and causes the game to be less fun and more of just a mosh pit of who gets ♥♥♥♥ed the most It is also pretty sad how the community turns against you even in the slightest when you attack the 'Clan Favorite' or 'Server Favorite' pretty much the Worst community the game is CHIVALRY yet there is Hardly any chivalry.. it is more the opposet of chivalry   6/10,-1,1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"With the 130 hours in mind, I can safely say this game is absolutely amazing. Far Cry 3 was a major development from the first 2 games, and has become without question, my most favourite game of all time. Far Cry 3 explores various themes, and carries quite an incredible storyline that is deceptively dark and powerful, even if the initial plot is very simple. I've played through Far Cry 3 at least 4 times, on every difficulty and tried different endings and choices. The first time I finished the game was by far, the most moving ending I've experienced in any game. It has great replayability, even after finishing Far Cry 4 I come back to this for the memories and unique gameplay. With amazing graphics, a gripping storyline, and such realistic gameplay, I still recommend Far Cry 3 today. I will never forget my time with Far Cry 3, it was the best experience I've ever had the pleasure to be part in. The map editor probably kept me entertained for months, and while I never played much co-op, what I did play was pretty fun. I personally prefer Far Cry 3 over 4, as it just feels more magical and special. I only hope that Far Cry 5 will return to the brutal and beautiful atmosphere that Far Cry 3 had, without completely redoing it (cough cough Far Cry 4).  So yes, Far Cry 3 is still worth every cent (and probably more to be honest). It still remains my most favourite game ever, and will for a very long time. Don't hold back on getting it, It's an unforgettable journey.",1,0,1

HOW TO: Survive your first night: No need to use any power cunsuming items until 2 AM, keep the phone guy talking until then, check the cameras after about a minute or so after the phone guy hangs up, keep checking on Bonnie in the WEST HALL, once he gets to the corner, close the left door. Wait until the camera shows that Bonnie has left the West hall corner and hall itself and make sure he is in the dining room before you open the left door. During that time, Chica will be in the East hall, keep alternatingly check on him and Bonnie until Chica moves to the East Hall Corner, and keep the door closed the rest of the night. Once Bonnie comes back for round 2 in the West Hall, close once he is in the corner, or you flash the light and he is there, keep checking on Bonnie, you will have little power left at this point, so conserve it, [(OPTIONAL) wait until he is at the end of the West Hall then open that door.] you can keep both doors closed and survive to Night 2.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I wasn't prepared for was how much of an utter disappoint this game was. In my opinion the HUD and terrible plot are MORE than enough to ruin the game, and it baffles me that anyone could even get past these two obstacles to even enjoy the game-play. Thankfully, I had installed a couple of mods to improve game-play (more accurate weapons and improved selection) and remove the HUD completely (the official patch didn't go anywhere near far enough in this regard), so the game I am scoring here is not the game I've been playing for the last three weeks, it's the game I would have been forced to play without the mods.  Seriously, who needs that amount of information flashing and bobbing around on their screen to tell them the SAME thing at least three times? The HUD elements, even with all the customisable ones turned off, turn a potentially enjoyable challenge into a ridiculously easy arcade game, where neither thought, exploration or initiative are required. Objectives tell you to 'find' this or 'locate' that, and yet the whereabouts of every objective, no, every STAGE of every objective, is indicated in three different places, two of which are on your HUD (not including what you can actually see with your eyes!). The AI of the enemies is fantastic, amongst the best I've encountered, but the poor sods don't stand a chance because they're splashed all over your mini-map and appear clearly, even behind objects, with big red icons over their heads.  And then there's the plot and characters. Unfortunately, no one's come up with a mod to make the plot or characters any more interesting, and no amount of HUD removal or weapon modding is going to help me give a damn about any of the characters and what's happening to them. Even your own, annoyingly vocal, character, Jason, is a hateful adolescent (not in years, but in behaviour), and his friends are all stereotyped air-heads with no substance.  I get the feeling there is more to the story than it first appears, and there's some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland' sub-plot going on (I've avoided plot spoilers), and that maybe there will be some kind of Fight Club-style reveal where it turns out Jason is actually Vaas, and vice-versa. But you know what? I just don't care any more. I'm about 8 hours into the game and have deliberately avoided following the story, not only because it's weak and the characters are hateful, but also because it means I'm likely to have to sit through endless boring cut-scenes, or stupid, arcade-style mini-games, or encounter the nemesis of any immersion junkie like myself, the dreaded quick-time event (seriously who actually LIKES quick-time events? Who buys a game and says to themselves, 'oh wow, I hope this game has LOTS of quick-time events). Why can't developers just let us PLAY the game, instead of constantly forcing our actions, or taking away our control all together. Valve and other progressive developers have proved time and again that you can have both a great game and a great immersive experience without compromising your in-game freedom, so why is there still this obsession with trying to turn games into movies?  It's a damn shame, because there are loads of things to love about FarCry 3; the hunting, the expanse of the island, the superb AI, the weapons, the beautiful graphics, the best motion-capture acting in a game (Vaas), but all of that can only last me so long, and I just don't want to be in the shoes of this character any more. I'd rather put Jason's friends out of their misery and explore the island.  With mods, such as the removal of the HUD and the improved weapon selection, I'd give the game a 6 out of 10. A better story would have probably meant an 8 or 9. But the vanilla game deserves nothing more than a 1, because developers need to realise that you just can't treat your audience like imbeciles.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Just played the game for an hour... And i've watched about 12 hours of content online leading up to launch. I do not enjoy the game enough to keep playing, it really has done a poor job of gripping my attention for very long:  over-hyped. features that have been discussed simply aren't there (for example - personalising hero's talked about in their livestream) game is overpriced... Doom has just came out for the same price by bethesda - so basically your best of buying doom over this. I could go on but it's better to summarise the points.  To start off with the good points: -The game has a great theme and brand 'warhammer'  -The Menu is good quallity and most the UI looks very clean -The game offers a wide array of combat tools, such as formations. -Lords/hero system is very unquie, skill tree's for commanders add an intresting mechanic to combat -Very easy to understand once you've got a hang of the system.  As for the bad points, this game has a tone of issuies: -This is a re-hash of rome 2's launch- buggy intro scenes, weird AI behavior (you're investing in an alpha game here.) -Completely overpriced for the brand (Games Workshop are doing this alot atm.) -Depdent on internet connection even in single player (for wiki information.) -Combat is really repeatitive after 3 battles that's it and auto-resolve might as well be auto suicide so you have to put up with each battle if you want good results.  -Preorder for OP Race, that's not at all fun to play. -Horrible tutorial, personally i learnt how to make a squad (then used wiki to learn the rest of the feautres)  -Not enough units for launch. DOW 1 had more units reffering back to year 2000 games. -Graphics are not all that great even on ultra.  -The UI is much 'clankier' then most total war games. -Disengaged from story after about 10 minutes. Not very immersive at all -Takes too much time to get into the game",-1,1,0

A pay-to-win with good solid gameplay and a healthy player-base, Planetside2 doesn't bring out the best in players who have actual skill, though if you're exceptional at FPS's this game will be quite enjoyable.  I'll lay out one 'Pro' and one 'Con' to give you an idea of its potential and short-comings.  Pro; The massive player-base allows for A LOT of actual tacticality. Both large-scale and small-time.  Con; Players whom have more money than skill will become VERY obvious, as the 'better' guns are exceedingly difficult (but not impossible) to attain in this game with consistent gameplay. 'Cash-cannnons' in the early levels give significant firepower/advantages over players who jump into this looking fer a good gunfight.  VERY skill-based game. VERY team oriented. If you don't care for the Call of duty or Battlefield franchises, but still want a decent FPS, you MIGHT find it here. I'd strongly recommend looking into other options first. (Such as the semi-decent Warframe, or a good console shooter like Army of Two or Gears of War).  1-to-5 Rating: 2 (Possible 3). (A well earned $40). If you're broke like myself, but just want to play a good FPS with relevant strategizing, this is for you. I don't recommend buying the guns in this game. AT ALL. It will kill the gameplay and competitive nature of this broad-scale FPS. The asthetic options however, are sometimes PLAYER-MADE!! VERY, VERY, good, material!! From Camouflage to player-armor visuals to semi-custom Decals, there's something there for you!!  =Edit= Post-700 Game-Hours Review: Just, don't play this unless you REALLY can't play anything else. Why this game made it into the 2k15 Top 50 FPS's, I don't know. With Daybreak Games (Nova Columbus) now in possession of this unbalanced sack of trash, it's been all downhill. New weapons that are too extreme are being put out. Nothing is getting properly balanced. Server stability is mediocre at best. If you must play this game, bring a superior computer and a superior connection on you'll be getting butchered left-and-right with no help from the dozens of people around you. If you're new, start as TR so you get the best sense of community and inter-play possible. I can no longer Recommend this game. Due in particular to the newer weapons, the ever-growing ranks of hateful try-hards, and the balancing ( that's never been there anyway, so oh well).",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Good luck getting anywhere without buying equipment first. As a big fan of First Person Shooters who easily gets 1.5 K.D. in COD, Battlefield, and all other FPS games I've played, I am at a solid .2 K.D. in this game. With the amount of time it takes to even buy a half decent gun, you've already died several hundred times.  Even as a Free-To-Play game, at least make the first couple guns stand a chance in combat. With the lack of instructions as well as a terrible tutorial, I found myself wandering around the huge map for hours with no clue how the whole air, vehicle, and infantry resources system worked along with other crucial information. Believing I would be spending hard earned credits that have taken several hours to achieve, I didn't want to spend any on any sort of vehicle.  Nothing was pointed out about this because the beginning tutorial didn't work at all. It would say to shoot the target dummies and kill 3, however you would shoot at them and the bullets would go right through them with no way of killing them. It eventually let me go through without being able to kill even one. Then the anti-vehicle lesson was next. Where at least in the last room the texture showed up but couldn't be killed, the tanks didn't even show up at the lesson. Making it impossible to continue through the tutorial. Exiting the game and then logging back in, I found myself having to start back at the beginning of the tutorial where the same problems occurred several times.   Air vehicle controls are awful. It's impossible to take down any sort of tank without firing FIVE rockets into them. There is no control manual readily available in-game(or convenient to find if there is one). The game promotes spawn camping as you are stuck in a tiny room when you spawn in a base that's being attacked. Incorrect times shown on overloaded generators while attacking/defending a big base(Mini map is the correct time, normally the time on the generator itself is 25+ seconds off. The sensitivity widely varies on what vehicles gun you're using and not being universal and fluent through-out all the vehicles weapons. Many more small frustrating flaws that can be found easily after a few hours of playing.  Overall, there are better uses of time and money that could be spent on games that feel more rewarding and don't leave you leave you yelling at your monitor pulling your hair out.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I should quantify everything that follows by first saying I was a HUGE fan of Planetside 1 (yeah...I have my CR5 VS Rexo as my profile picture on Steam).  I've just not been able to get in to PS2 at all however. The primary reason for this would likely be because it plays nothing like the first game - it retains the same kind of scope, but for the most part the core mechanics are completely different.   I realise now I was hoping for a graphically-updated clone of PS1, and while I accept that wouldn't exactly constitute 'progress', I'm not convinced that the design decisions made here push the game on in any great leaps and bounds. As an example, it's worth comparing the inventory or loadout system of the two games. In PS1, players built their own loadouts from the ground up with overall carrying capacity dictated by the type of armour worn. The weapons and equipment available were restricted by the branches of the various combat disciplines that had been unlocked - using points gained by levelling one's character. This approach allowed for HUGE variation between loadouts for individual characters and meant that genuine mulit-tasking was possible. By contrast, PS2 has a much more rigid and defined class system which will be more familiar to players of 'traditional' shooters and is arguably less daunting to get to grips with - if ultimately more generic and unsatisfying.  Less tangible - but equally off-putting, for me at least - is the feel of the battles. PS1 often had very clearly defined battle lines and it was possible to sense and react to the ebb and flow of battle. I don't get this in PS2 at all. Large outdoor fights give the impression of many self-contained deathmatches all going on at once and seem utterly disorganised. Is this a result of the pacing of the game? Possibly. I believe the TTK may be generally lower than it was in the original and this coupled with the faster character movement undeniably makes the game a very diffeerent proposition to the first.  I'm quite sure than in its own right, the fare on offer is enjoyable to many - just don't expect anything like the slow(ish) pace of the first game and the almost 'trench warfare' scenarios that could develop.  Overall, I really wanted to like this game but the sad truth for me is that it's lost too much of what made the original so special.  4/10  ProdigalSon (Emerald)",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Having played all the Total War games, I can safely say that, for me, this is the worst Total War game of all time. I'll admit that I am biased against non-historical titles, but I will make sure to focus this review only on the gameplay problems which I encountered.  In terms of battle experience, the battles happen extremely quickly, far too quickly for my liking. This means that the result of a battle is largely decided by unit volume and stats rather than by tactical maneuvers. The hero and general units make battles even worse. On one occasion, I had won a tactical victory, routing a superior enemy army. However, the enemy general, the only remaining enemy, defeated all of my remaining units, even when they were attacking him from all sides.  I found the campaign map to be too limited, with few expansion patterns available to the player. This is made even worse by the feature which prevents certain factions from capturing either cities or holds. Also, the lack of navies really limits the gameplay style options.  The rosters of many factions seem to be distinguished by the lack of a crucial unit type, which means most of your campaign strategy revolves around compensating for tactical inflexibilities. The dwarves lack cavalry, the vampires lack missile units. This really limits what army types you can field, meaning that building armies is largely about volume rather than quality.  Another thing to mention is the new seige mechanics, which further reduce the tactical options by forcing the player to deploy at the city walls and charge immediately, due to the arrow towers. The town battles have also been removed, for no apparent reason, reducing tactial variety even further.  To sum up this game - it is severely lacking in variety and flexibility, both in a strategic and tactical sense. It is a betrayal of the core fanbase of Total War, who were drawn to the title for the unrivaled tactical flexibility which the battles offered.",-1,1,0

The gameplay varies in this game depending on what playstyle you wish to perform. Will you go in guns blazing, or take everyone out stealthfully one by one. The story will intice you and i recommend thinking deeper than the surface, and to pay attention to 'certain' loading screens. The graphical quality is something to be proud of, its a beatiful game with many ways to experience the color of the flora and fauna. But i highly recommend this game for a unique experience diving into the human scyque with everyone comming away with their own interpretation of each character. I highly recommend for anyone looking to think beyond the surface of a shooter.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Great game.  But the first real DLC is coming and it's $20 DLC for a SINGLE race. Their justification is that it has more content than a normal DLC because they had to make more animations for the new units. Meanwhile for $20 you can get Witcher 3 which offers a hundred hours of gameplay. Yeah, no. $20 for one race is absolutely unacceptable. They also charged $3 for blood. $3 for a 7MB patch that adds some almost invisible particle effects.   Don't buy this until you can get it AND all the DLC on sale, probably months from now.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"At one point in time I would have recommended this game, but it has seemingly been abandonded by the dev team. The last update it recieved was some killing floor 2 skins, the most recent actual content if I recall has been over a year ago. The skill in this game is abusing a very, very bad physics system. The better you get at this game, the more you'll be crouched and spinning with a massive sword. It's great to play once in a while for some cheap fun, and this often goes on sale for ~5 dollars (USD) One of the other biggest problems with the game is the player base. It's not toxic or anything but there are two types of C:MW players. One guy has played 100+ hours and plays a lot, the other got the game on sale for 5 bucks and sucks really bad. Theres not really an inbetween and this causes a massive skill gap that is both annoying for veterens because they have little challenge, and for new players becuase they get obliterated.  If the developer ever adds more content, it would still be a fantastic game other complaints aside.   Pros: Very satisfying to get kills in Wonderful looking Runs pretty smoothly Fall to your death server is super fun  Cons Terrible physics Hit boxes are pretty wonky at times Not updated Some weapons have literally no use and is a completely trash (i.e sling) Some weapons preform so well, even other weapons in the same tier aren't worth using because it's signifigantly better (i.e maul, norse sword)  Overall, in the current state I wouldn't buy/play it, but IF updated and more people played would be fantastic.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I played PS1 for many years, and safe to say that even after 4 years, PS2 is still an unrefined piece of hot garbage. The influence from modern FPS is pretty clear given the faster pace, but this results in frustratingly short rounds and plenty of instant death.  It's better with a squad, but even then you're just trying to cover up flawed game mechanics with the social environment of a unit. PS1 felt like something unique. PS2 feels like Battlefield with more waiting involved before you get to shoot something. On the off chance you do get to shoot something, it's usually zerg time by then, and you're in a 100v100 messy zergfest that will send your FPS tanking thanks to ♥♥♥♥ poor optimization after FOUR YEARS of refinement.  If you want a superior FPS experience, there are better ones out right now. If you want a superior Free To Play game, there are better ones out right now. I'm kind of amazed that after four years this game still runs and plays like garbage even on modern rigs. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO READ A YOUTUBE GUIDE ON TWEAKING AN .INI FILE IN ORDER TO GET THE GAME TO GIVE ME 30-40 FPS MOST OF THE TIME.  Edit (updated): Did I mention shallow?  Hoo boy. PS1 had strategy you know, not just tactics. And if you know the difference between those two things, then you'll understand that strategy in PS2 is nigh impossible. All conts (all four of them, of which usually only 2 are unlocked at a time oh lawd) are always in a perpetual 3 way, meaning unless one empire is getting gang-banged, it's basically a stalemate. Due to how easy it is to pull Galaxies from Warpgates, and most importantly how easy it is to REDEPLOY, you can re-mobilize a force from one base and shuttle them across the entire continent in under a minute. Considering the cap times on bases, it results in making it painfully hard to take territory without an army showing up within 60 seconds of the base starting to cap.  We're supposed to be trying to win these 'Alerts' with 'Victory Points' but I've never seen people playing who actively pursue VPs. Everyone's busy grinding Achivements ('Directives') for their various weapons, or kill farming an AMS (Sunderers now, guess that's one way to get people to drive that piece of ♥♥♥♥) somewhere to pad their oh-so-important stats.  Things that should be baseline (AMS Cloak, medpack) are locked behind hundreds or even thousands of certs. Arguably it's balanced because you can pull a default version of everything (Air Cav / Tanks without needing cert) but go figure since you can cert into actual performance upgrades for these things, you will be at a disadvantage against someone who has adorable little things like side armor when you don't.  Good luck. The game was and is a mad cash grab. The pace is manic compared to PS1, and strategy is nonexistent. If you enjoy imaginary treadmills where you farm 1000 kills with 3-4 versions of the same gun and listen to neckbeards argue on coms which version is the best while whittling away your hours in this garbage, be my guest.  It's a time waster at best.",-1,1,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"11/10  In the beginning there was just being...  As just being wasn't enough, certain needs arose; food, water, sex, and sleep took priority. WIth those things accomplished, security and safety took precedent. Family, friendship and societal needs soon followed. This lead to self-esteem and confidence. With all of these handled, there was time for problem solving and self actualization. Rising above this entire hierachy of needs came the click.  The entire evolutionary process our species led to the developement of Clicker Heroes.  With Clicker Heroes now a part of my life, I have no need to self actualize nor solve problems, just click.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"The game is okay, with a relatively large world, plenty to do, and scenery to appreciate. The main story is your basic Far Cry story: you were vacationing, now you've been forcibly transformed into a killing machine. You level up by tattooing yourself, with 'perks' (gaining new abilities like takedowns and being able to cook grenades, and passive abilities like more health and better healing) and you can level through doing practically anything. The gameplay is pretty fun, but for the most part enemies are dumb (avoiding cover and running right at you) and pretty easy to kill early-on.   However, it's also a console port, with lots of technical problems associated with it. Even with a GTX 770 (which can run Metro: Last Light on ultra with zero framerate problems) I cannot run this game on ultra. Why? Because it's unoptimized. Especially on some of the more hectic parts of the campaign where there are lots of things happening. Even on LOW, I barely manage to reach a semi-stable 60 FPS. There is a FoV slider and plenty of options to tweak, but they don't really seem to do much of anything. After some testing, this is because I was running the game on DX11. Running the game on DX9 gives me a much better framerate on ultra. Again, it's a console port.   On top of that, you have to deal with Ubisoft's inevitable Uplay nonsense. This program interferes with Steam's own Gameoverlay.exe program, which allows you to talk to your friends. Meaning that when/if you get a message, you have to minimize the game, respond, then re-enter the game and re-maximize it (oh, and it enters windowed mode whenever you minimize. You can quickly go back to fullscreen with alt + enter, though).  Oh, also, a lot of the screenshots in the store page are what you would call 'bullshots.' Pre-rendered lies. The game does look good, but while you're hangliding or wingsuit flying, you'll really notice how painted on a lot of the foliage is when you notice it's flat.",1,0,1

However, this is a terrible Total War game.   Streamlined to the detriment of strategic and tactical value. Family trees gone again, public order/taxes management is gone - you can only either tax or not tax a province. The sieges are a complete disaster - every city/town looks the same, theres only one wall and the braindead AI even with the help of the excellent Radious Mod is just standing there, not participating. Chaos is defeated very easily, I havent even had a chance to fight any of them before they were destroyed. For me as a both TW and Warhammer fan, I cannot bring myself to like any of the four factions - the Vampire Counts are the closest to being ok, but the game becomes boring for me after a few turns anyway. Out of the Legendary Lords, I do not find any of those available even remotely sympathetic - so I just play with the regular lords, who can die thus creating some sort of tension and attachment.   The intersting thing here is the corruption. Either spreading it, or fighting against it. Thats something new.   However, I cannot in good heart recommend this game to either Warhammer fans or Total War fans. Just wait for the next one.

Both maps are very small, the second map adding a few more funny things, but not enough to keep me interested. The game is surprisingly demanding for the size of those maps and the overall low graphics, likely because of all the separate interactable objects.

However when you realize what you can do to help the mission and overtake the maps.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"It took a real steamer like Fallout 4 to make me look at this a second time. Is it still full of ideas that run contrary to the spirit of the franchise? Sure. Is it still awfully written? Decidedly. Even then, this is still more ambitious and more successful when it puts in the effort than Fallout 4 is at it's very best.  The ability to make weapons out of junk was great. I do like the attempt to prune down on useless skills from the classic series. There is a real crushing sense of atmosphere, it drives home the point that this is a very mean place that does not like you one bit. Everything about Galaxy News Radio is great.   The main issue I have with the writing is that there are plenty of things in there that feel faithful to the franchise or just taking it to it's foregone conclusion, but very few of those are tied into the main story. That aside they had a interesting area like DC and have nothing really all that visually memorable. Lots of green and grey and brown. The weapons and armor are also horribly imbalanced against themselves.  Anchorage is a linear, dull slog. The Pitt is amazing and showcases what the Bethesda writing team is capable of when they put some effort into it. Broken Steel is garbage. Point Lookout is very challenging, but interesting for it's non-linearity. Zeta is just Anchorage 2.0, this time in SPACE!  Oh, and Oasis never happened.",1,0,1

The AI is better than in previous games, although in diplomacy  it makes weird choises, quite frequently giving you money for no good reason.  Pros -Setting- Warhammer is one of the most diverse and lore rich settings with  unique factions and really great art. -Accuracy- CA mannaged to capture the feel of WH with all the quests, events and faithfulness to WH art design. -Diversity- although there are not that many factions yet every one is a unique play experiance. Battles are very enteretaning with all the monsters, weapons, heros and magic.  Cons To be honest I don't think there are that many major problems with the game. I have only some problems with Chaos Warriors as they (yet again in a wh game) do not  live up to their miniature version. The units are somewhat boring without all the Chaos God  specific versions of them and where is Archaon's epic new mount?:).  I also hope there will be two other Chaos facions, mainly for Chaos Daemons.  I'am very happy with how the game turned out and with the fact that CA went the route of  quality over quantity.

Sure it had bugs, a lot of them, but it's an indie game, if we give them time they'll sort it out, right? Dead ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. If you had asked me when this game first released, I would have told you it was a must have, that it was my favorite game. Now, this is a waste of your time and of your money. This game has become plagued with DLC, sure, they're only skins so it's not a big deal, or it wouldn't be a big deal if Torn Banner actually gave two ♥♥♥♥s about the community. Since they don't, this game is still plagued with bugs, bugs that Torn Banner refuses to fix because they're too busy making DLC. The barbarian skins that were released today are the last ♥♥♥♥ing straw. $8 per skin for a single class, and $2 a pop for the four new weapon skins! To buy all the skins is $40, fourty ♥♥♥♥ing dollars. That's more than the ♥♥♥♥ing game; you would think that with all the DLC TB would release some bug fixes, but no, they don't give half of a sack of ♥♥♥♥ about their fans. There's also no point in even playing this game if you don't know how to drag. People will tell you dragging is a tactic but it isn't, it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that eliminates the need of any skill whatsoever. It makes it difficult to block with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s spinning all over the place, slowing down or speeding up their swings at will. It's pretty common to see an instakill weapon swing coming at you with more speed than a dagger. Does Torn Banner care about this? No, the motehr♥♥♥♥ers actually encourage it and call it a tactic. Not because it is, but because TB is too ♥♥♥♥ing busy wallowing in their piles of money. Don't waste your breath on this game, but Mount &amp; Blade Warband instead.",-1,0,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This title offers engrossing and engaging strategic and tactical gameplay in a high fantasy setting. The rich lore and pregnant storytelling of the Warhammer universe launches the player into a cataclysmic countdown towards Chaos invasions and the End Times, against the backdrop of petty bickering between the nations of mortal men. A grim, fatalistic mood grips us as we become more and more determined to beat back the raving, apocolyptic hordes of the Everchosen. My empire has crumbled and been reduced to ash multiple times but I still keep coming back for more.   I wouldn't pay much attention to the occasional nasty reviews from angry basement-dwellers ... just look at the number of people playing the game at any given time and that should give you a sense of how fun this title really is.",1,1,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3, surprisingly, is a game that was actually developed and made by Bethesda, and not a fan made mod. This is surprising because from just playing it, it can be hard to tell at times. I know I'm late to writing this review, but I wanted to remind both myself and anyone who reads this of how Fallout 3 was in case Fallout 4 doesn't seem as good as it looks when it comes out. (It may not look like it with the 90 minutes I have tracked, but I have completed the game twice; once from a retail copy and more recently through New Vegas using the Tale of Two Wastelands mod.)  Fallout 3 is set in the Capital Wasteland, a new location set on the opposite side of the US from the traditional west coasts of Fallout 1, 2, and later New Vegas. By doing this, they allowed themselves to have a clean slate of sorts, and have more creative freedom in writing the story. So naturally, being skilled writers as they are, they just copied a bunch of stuff from the old games and rewrote it to be worse. The Brotherhood of Steel is back, only this time they're a splinter faction that's a bunch of goodie two-shoes that go from shunning you to thanking you for letting them bask in your presence over the course of one quest (the 'real' brotherhood is still technically there in the form of the Outcasts, but they barely have any presence in the game). The Enclave is back for no real reason at all, considering they were pretty much ended in 2. They made up their own east coast brand of super mutant just so they could flood the game with them. Even things like caps don't really make sense, since the only reason caps were used as currency in the west coast games is because they were backed by the Hub. The whole game just feels like they went through a picture book of Fallout and saw cool things and went 'hey that looks cool, let's put it in our game too!' without really thinking that much about why they would actually be there.  Gameplay-wise, the game is a mixed bag. The exploration can be pretty fun, especially with mods like DC Interiors (which opens up a bunch of the boarded up buildings that Bethesda was too lazy to furnish), but the shooting is fairly subpar, and you can tell that the engine wasn't really built for shooting games at that stage of its development. Of course, you can always use VATS if you'd rather watch the game play itself instead, since it's effectively been turned into an easy button that lets you have 5 turns to blow an enemy to pieces and then gives the enemy one. The whole stat system is a joke, and between the rate you get perks, the perks added by DLCs, and the bobbleheads scattered throughout the world, it's almost impossible to not end up with 10 in every SPECIAL stat and 100 in every skill by the time you finish the game.   Because it's basically impossible to specialize in any particular ability due to inevitably having to specialize in all of them, and the fact that the game doesn't really give you any major choices that have actual consequences, it can be difficult to feel like you're actually roleplaying in Fallout 3. But that's fine, because it's pretty much impossible with the dialogue anyways. The dialogue options are, as best as I can describe them, schizophrenically written. You can blow up an entire settlement and laugh it off, then five minutes later meet a group of people you believe to be cannibals and have no dialogue option to say anything other than something negative towards them. At one point early in the game you meet a ghoul bartender, and your only options are two choices of mocking him and the last option, 'Let me think about it for a moment, my good man.', which is so cringey that I can only assume that if Bethesda's animators had any talent it would be accompanied by an animation of the player character tipping an imaginary top hat and taking a puff from a wooden pipe. Most of the intelligence choices are just repeating what someone just said to you back to them in a summarized form written in an overly wordy way, and a lot of the speech checks go beyond ridiculousness in terms of convincing people or things to do things they would never realistically do in a single sentence. The game has a karma system, but I don't know if it's even possible to keep a negative karma level because of how much of it you get dumped onto you just for things like killing ghouls or raiders (which are impossible to allign with because Fallout 3 has no faction system), but it doesn't really matter because it's not even that much fun to play evil. There are no real meaningful evil choices, just a bunch of 'for the laughs' things. There are one or two noteworthy evil moments and then the rest of it is just 'ahaha i shoot you in the face' options in dialogue that just aren't really fulfilling, and some of them are just plain nonsensical and make no sense for the player to do, like the one at the end of the Broken Steel DLC. The game also has two factions that hunt you down depending on whether your karma is too high or low, but while the evil karma version is a group of lawbringers who are hunting you down because you're a known criminal, the good varient just gets Talon Company, a mercenary unit that Bethesda just made up and gave no backstory aside from 'they're bad guys and so they want to kill good guys because they're really bad people!' and set them loose on you.  The DLC is about what you would expect so far. Operation Anchorage is essentially just a 3 hour crappy military corridor FPS with a few good rewards, Mothership Zeta is a crappy space corridor shooter with a few good rewards, and Broken Steel is only worth playing because of the fact that it basically forces you to after the end of the base game. The Pitt and Point Lookout are basically the only ones that I would consider 'good', with the former being a brief but interesting quest line and a relatively fun collectathon with some good rewards and the latter being the only dlc to give a more open experience in a new map with new side quests and things to explore. If it wasn't for the fact that the GOTY edition costs the same as buying regular fallout 3 + point lookout + the pitt I'd just tell you to buy those, but oh well.  Fallout 3 is what I would consider a 'popcorn RPG'. It's the kind of game where you can spend 100 hours just exploring the wasteland and looting buildings and doing side quests and then remember that there's a boring main storyline for you to do, but it's not a game where you have to make choices or develop a character or anything associated with more in-depth RPGs, and while to an extent I feel that way about all of Bethesda's post-Morrowind RPGs, Fallout 3 in particular exemplifies the concept. If you're new to the Fallout series you may love it, or if you've played them all you can probably still just forget that it's a Fallout game and have fun exploring, but it's both a terrible RPG and a terrible Fallout game. It's extremely unstable on its own, so either modding it to high heaven or playing it through New Vegas in the A Tale of Two Wastelands mod (which requires both games and all of their DLC) is basically required. If you have time to kill and just want to relax in the wasteland for a little while, there's no reason not to buy Fallout 3 if it's on sale and you've got nothing else to play, but there just isn't anything exceptional that would prompt me to actively recommend the game. Hopefully Bethesda will have learned from New Vegas when we get to play Fallout 4.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Alot of the bad reviews for this game will be about the Total War DLC policy. Yes the policy isn't that great and can be kind of unfogiving in the amount of content you could miss with it. The fact is the game can run well without the DLC's and they are there for people who want to spend the money increasing the content in their games.  The game itself was very well made from an artistic standpoint. The models and animations were well designed and the in-battle maps were plenty and very often different from most others. The gameplay was well executed and smooth and the lore was put throughout the game in a subtle but easily accessible way.  While the game was fun to play, the unit count on release was very lackluster and unless you were playing orcs or dwarves you had very little choice in your army compositions. (As much as it shouldn't need to happen it can be rectified with the use of the radious mod which adds many different units for each race.)",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I was at first excited to play this game, I had seen videos on youtube and thought it would be fun. Well, its not. Overall: 2/10  Pros first (short list): -Fair Graphics for no visual lag. -Fairly easy controls for all that you can do. -Tons of servers to play on.  Cons (long list): -The games physics as relates to bows is a joke, base-line bows of the time had much better distance and travel time on arrows. -Lengths of weapons are not properly simulated, Classes with the heaviest armor seem to be the weakest (Note on history: anyone in that time period who wore that level of armor was raised to be a soldier from a really young age, they could realitively easily scale walls in full body armor and their weapons, this game fails to simulate that.) -Mapping as for running and slashing is fine, but the Archer class is highly ignored in the designs with a massive lack of elevated areas to shoot from, as was the case in history in defence situations with Archers using walls, towers and rooftops. -Armor ranking seems to mean next to nothing between the classes. -While friendly damage is expected, the penalties for it I found rather stupid given archers always end up hitting friendlies (been on both ends of the bow.) -Team killing/wounding is a common and idiotic happening in this game and commonly makes for failed team matches. Specially when 80% of your teams on FFA right outside the spawn.  There is a much longer list of things I found that makes this game undesirable to play, but I dont feel like its worth the time writing that much out.   In short: If you know anything about history and/or have held/used the real weapons, dont play this game. If you just love seeing tons of gore and blood and dont really care at all about a game being based on a historical time period being inaccurate as heck, then I would suggest this is a game for you.",-1,0,0

I know a bunch of people are going to hate me for this, but this game needs a lot of tweaking.   FNAF is basically a game where you are a security guard trying to stop these starnge Chucky cheese type dolls from killing you. You do that with your 10 FPS Cameras and doors that take electricity to close. Wait until morning (6:00) you win. You do this for 6 nights until you finally reach night seven which is custom mode. Setting the API for the animatronics however you would like. Although Scott made a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money off of this game I don't see why this game is so called 'exhilirating' or '♥♥♥♥ pants horror'. Half of the time all you do is sit on your ♥♥♥ waiting. all you do is wait, and then if you win you're rewarded with a slow ♥♥♥ 70's clock that turns into the time.

Graphics are pretty damn nice. ♥♥♥♥ single player, unlike some games where the only fun part is the multiplayer Chivalry doesn't worry about even trying to make a single player that sucks, instead they focus on the multiplayer c:   Now the important part is the cons list...   CONS! The Pros, by pros I mean people who play this game a lot... It's brutal when you fight someone with 800 hours... pros also act like ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I accidently hit the guy with my sword (and it's hard NOT TO hit someone when your in a tight pack) so he decides to kill everyone around him on his team because he didn't know who did it.   Team Killing It's hard not to hit someone when you have a giant sword and you're trying to not die, the community is also very unforgiving, I saw someone covered in blood and I thought they had red on them so I killed them, turns out it was a teammate, I said sorry and he then stalked me around the map and killed me every time he could.  Thats about all I can think of for a CONS list.  Bottom line is the community is very unforgiving but this game is so worth it!

570,Dota 2,"the best game since the invention of computer  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  the previous simple review was written 2 years ago, now i have to say something new.  This game is only nice for the people which can really maintain in good mood or the people which don't care about the win or lose.  Usually people will say, 'I don't care i'll win or lose, it's just a game.' but when you are playing with some ppl which just want to ruin the game, or just don't know how to play his hero, you'll feel angry, i'm sure.  Imagine one of your teammates chose invoker and kept dying in the mid line. then when team fights was going, you finally figured out that he casted his skills without any rotation just randomly, i don't think that you can have happy feeling about that. and also, after 30min you lost the game, you get nothing, no mmr and no happiness, for 30min.  i don't mean that everyone need to win each match, i mean everyone need to win or lose each match with high quality. sometimes because of picks and boosters we lost some games, i feel ok, we deserved that. but if we have good picks, and only one or two of us are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, do you think the rest of us feel happy? no, definitely no.  and also, the mmr system is so simple, staffs in valve even don't bother to establish a new system or a new algorithm. let me tell you if some staffs can read this. in China there is a platform called 11 for dota1 in WC3. the mmr you get depends on your performance. if you win the game but you perform very badly, you will get +0, if you lose a game but you perform very well, you will get +5. now the mmr system in dota2 is like, no matter how hard you try, if there is someone in your team want to throw the game and you lost it, you still get -25. that is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  i'll uninstall the game in 5 min. maybe i'll be back in the future, but some bad experiences will never be forgotten.",1,1,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I'm still in the very first real area of the game (area covered by the first radio tower). The game has crashed 3 times. There are lengthy cut scenes at the beginning of the game that cannot be skipped through as well, making recovery from the game crashing extremely tedious. The interface to select weapons, loot creatures on the ground, and view objectives is poor. The very first fight of the game (running away into the jungle and struggling with the pirate with a knife) requires mashing the jump button. 'Mashing' is a ridiculous action to perform on a PC, and undesirable to do on any platform outside of a video arcade. This game has potential (open world, interesting crafting system, and good voice acting), but the execution of the gameplay and stability is very subpar.  All of the above makes the game below average, and then there is the Uplay DRM. There are plenty of other reviews that cover Uplay, none of which are positive.  Edit: I am saddened that I cannot rate this game lower than 'Not Recommended'. On my second day of playing, while trying to load my saved game, the game has crashed 3 times on 3 attempts.

I'd have to say that it's still fun but not in the Far Cry kind of way. Story is well written, characters too, gameplay is fun in the rambo kind of way not so much the survival style, story does NOT match the gameplay at all.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare," (Wow, I hit the character limit for reviews. I didn't know that was a thing.)   Note: My focus of this review will be on the Archer class. I understand that the melee combat is the selling point of this game, and I will touch on it. But I often see tons of people talk about what is wrong with the melee system, and I feel like the issues surrounding the Archer don't get acknowledged as much as they should.    (Also note that this review will be VERY lengthy; I doubt that very many people will see it, but I want to make sure that the few that do know the state that Chivalry is in. But another big reason that I'm writing this is the fact that I loved this game, and hate to see what has happened to it. This is why my review is rather biased.)      Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has suffered a problem that contrasts the stereotypical 'indie game': A fair bit of the stuff you find from indie companies tends to be a half-a**ed alpha/beta version that runs terribly and is in dire need of improvement. (At least, this is one of many images that the term 'indie' has received.) And in the majority of those cases, the game is later abandoned by the developer(s), and left to rot; it never becomes a better game. Well, Chivalry has run this course backwards: What started out as a flawed, but overall well-executed game has become a pile of glitches and 'features' that has chased away several long-term players, myself being one.      --- Summary (of how the gameplay functions, that is) ---    So let's go over the basics of gameplay. There are four classes: Knight, Vanguard, Man-At-Arms, and Archer. The Knight is a tank class that wields many strong two-handed weapons, along with a secondary one-handed weapon and shield. The Vanguard is an assault class that, while having less protection than the Knight, utilizes a number of heavy swords, spears, and halberds. The Vanguard is capable of charging: After sprinting around for a period of time, he will place his arms in a locked-position of sorts. This indicates that, when you left-click, he will lunge forward and strike the enemy, dealing a massive blow that can even one-shot some classes. The third class, the Man-At-Arms, is agile. He can 'dodge' out of the way of attacks by means of either double-tapping a directional button, or a 'One-button dodge' shortcut, configurable in the Settings. With swords and maces, this class is about running in, avoiding attacks, and landing moderate, fast damage to enemies. This would be the last melee class recommended to new players, due to its low health and dodging mechanics that can be somewhat difficult to understand. Finally, the Archer is the black sheep: His primary weapon consists of either a bow, a crossbow, or javelins. Depending on which you choose, you'll either be in the back firing arrows at enemy classes to weaken/kill them, taking out enemy Archers to help your teammates, or charge into melee range and act as both a fighter as well as a distraction. This class has the lowest health of all, and should avoid melee combat as often as possible.    All attacks cost energy, which is depleted from a bar that appears on-screen with the health bar. Swinging without hitting somebody (and with it, feinting), parrying/blocking, holding a loaded arrow on the bow, and kicking use up some of this energy. And when that bar runs out, you can no longer do combo attacks, and if you parry/block an attack, you get stunned for a little while, which gives the enemy the chance you attack you while you're unable to defend yourself. You have to wait until it recharges before heading back into combat.    The way that maps work on servers is very similar to other PvP games: You have your standard Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, etc.. I won't go over how each of them works, because I assume that you'll either already know, or are willing to take a couple minutes to look them up. In addition to these, you also have two gamemodes that aren't seen quite as often: Duel, in which a group of people are put up against eachother in a 1 v.s 1 style, and the person with the most amount of victories at the end is declared the winner. And the second, Team Objective: In this mode, players are placed on two teams of either 12 or 16, where one is playing offense, and the other, defense. One of the teams has a set of goals that they must accomplish in a set period of time, before they end up losing the match. The other team's objective is to stop them from achieving those goals. If offense wins, then the two move on to the next objective. These objectives can range from things such as pushing a wagon through a gate, shooting down a barricade with a Ballista, slaying peasants, and even killing one of the two military generals that commands the teams: Feydrid Kearn, and Malric Terrowin.    The game supports player-owned servers, as well as modding. But to raise your rank (which is, for the most part, simply just a number), you have to play on the official Torn Banner-hosted servers. Your 'rank' allows you to unlock special helmets at different levels: At 30, you get a silver version of the default helmets. At 40, a Black version of the Veteran helmets, a gold at 50, and a pink at 60, etc.. You can also gain access to veteran helmets by unlocking all the primary weapons of a class, which involves getting a specific number of kills using any of the weapons in a section of the weapons list.      --- The Issues ---    So, what are the problems with this game? Well, as I mentioned at the start, this is a game that has gone sour the more it gets updated. At the start, people were presented with a game that uses a combat system that relied on timing, accuracy, focus, and didn't have the sort of 'whoever attacks first, wins' feeling that arises from other PvP games, namely first-person shooters. People appeared to have clung to that idea, and as a result, made Chivalry quite a popular game. At one point (in 2013, if I'm not mistaken), they had sold over 1.2 million copies of the game, which is rather impressive for a first standalone game (as it originally started out as a Half-Life 2 mod by the name of 'Age of Chivalry'). Over time, though, that good combat system has deteriorated, to the point that people have left the game entirely.    To make a long story short: Certain melee weapons in the game have been unbalanced for a very long time (some from the very start, from what I've been told by friends), and continue to be unbalanced to this day, 3-4 years later. Torn Banner has adopted the idea of 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' when it comes to the fighting styles that you see. For example, if you turn your player to have their back face the enemy, crouch, point your camera straight up to the sky, and perform an overhead, the weapon will strike the enemy and deal damage to them during the 'wind-up phase'. (This is supposed to be the point where your character is readying their weapon for a strike, and gives players a short window of time to counter-strike, before they have to block or dodge out of the way.) And if your weapon is slow enough, such as the Maul for the Knight, then you can turn your character around after the 'reverse-overhead' attack lands, and hit your opponent twice, which will kill anybody, assuming they don't block either one or both of the attacks. Another combat style, which is used heavily now-a-days, is known as 'dragging'. This is a very basic concept: If you swing your weapon to the left, then you turn right during the attack to 'drag' your weapon, thus slowing the swing speed and causing your opponent to (hopefully) block too early.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3: How can I describe it in words that do it justice? Besides the obvious fact that it is well worthy of GoTY for whatever the hell year it's from.  Similar to Bethesda's other open-world games like Skyrim and FO:NV, FO3 is the type of game where there is a story to follow, but it takes place in an expansive world and it is soley up to you if you want to play through the story or not. The game's atmosphere accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish, you're alone in the wide, desolated ruins of Washington D.C. with all sorts of dangers lurking around each corner, from robots to bandits to mutated hulks and irradiated zombies. Another huge contribution to the openness (a word I just made up) of the game is a massive artillary of weapons ranging anywhere from antique guns to jury-rigged sledge hammers to retro sci-fi laser guns. All topped off with a level up and perk system that is quick, to the point and doesn't interfere with gameplay.  Fallout 3 has aged well, and is still an enjoyable experience worth the dollar.  Also, Liam Neeson. If that isn't enough to convince you then there is no hope for you.  ***UPDATE*** I think I'm bloody well cursed. Fallout 3, like Fallout: New Vegas has again done nothing but impress me in all aspects possible, but I just cannot fully enjoy for some nagging reason that prevents me from picking it up and playing it.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"[Review written 15,06,2015] [After Fallout NV] Minor disclaimer before the review; I have actually played around 30hrs of this game upon time of review, however steam doesn't count it as I run the game through FOSE launcher for windows 7 stability reasons.   Fallout 3 is one of the most atmospheric games I’ve played. Fallout 3 unlike its Mojave counterpart describes a world of hardship and fear with a large emphasis on villainy and morality. Much like the people of the wastes the player too must choose how to play, either in self-serving villainy or selfless heroism. Choses can be made via dialogue options or real-time decision making. Combat in Fallout 3 is an excellent cross between fps and real-time strategy, as the player is able to battle using their own accuracy and skill or by entering VATS which pauses the game and allow the player to make precise shots at certain enemy weak points. Graphically Fallout 3 was a masterpiece of its time, however today Fallout 3 is showing its age as some ground and wall textures are looking quite muddy. The one gripe I would have to say about Fallout 3 is that it doesn’t give you an awful lot of direction in the beginning of the game which could turn off some first timers to the series. All in all Fallout 3 is still to this day one of the greatest RPG’s ever created with its enthralling atmosphere and solid combat system.  I give fallout 3 a 9.5/10  ",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,"NO.. You might have the Dota 2 Logo all bright and shiny everywhere in the UI but this is not Dota. After this mandatory pre-beta Reborn download it's just been downhill, hit rockbottom and kept digging. After every update, it just gets worse.   I'm fine with cinks and bugs, I freely participate in Beta releases like Hots, Reborn, Windows 10 etc. It's not the bugs, it's all these changes, that has made me hesitate to double-click the Dota icon for me. After 700+ hours Dota takes away levels and gives me an icon that changes when I level up. Great but now the one match I'm playing with people with 1000+ hours and it's how Dota always was. Next, a match with people who don't even have a steam profile yet. The experience mmr bracket is ruined by the new levelling system incorporated into this chaos.  The T5I is over and the compendium rewards are STILL buffering. We were supposed to get them easily 4-5 months ago. 'There have been compatibility issues regarding the desert terrain and the axe immortal is still being made', fine you're busy, but then why rush a pre-beta then and release several treasury items when we're still waiting for what we paid for since the beginning of 2015?  I'm not saying it's a horrible game, I'm saying it's not what it was and I don't like the direction it's going into. It changed too much too quickly, it's missing several key factors that is being pushed aside for the illusion of progress.

Если же ты игрок с 3k про поднятие MMR стоит в принципе забыть, потому что это не реально, за исключением если ты не БОГ.И если из игры вышел один игрок, статистика засчитывается всем, учитывая то каждую 3 игру покидают. Но виновата вся команда.   Вещи которыми постоянно торгую это тоже отдельный разговор. На мой взгляд вещи редкости Immortal должны представлять из себя гораздо больше чем просто светящаяся палочка, мы же не гарри поттера играем.... В итоге Immortal и rare не отличаются ни чем, только ценой, а цены такие устанавливают я даже не имею представления какие дураки... (жаль что нельзя материться) Но из года в год это не меняется, но деньги текут рекой. Привет школьникам.)   В итоге действительно хорошие игроки, про себя я не говорю, я сейчас про PRO игроков которым это задолбало и они уходят в другие игры, более стабильные и в которые играть действительно становится интересно, да тот же SC, HotS.  В нее можно адекватно играть с друзьями или в лобби, ну а про solo я уже высказался, мусор.  Самое интересное что каждые пытается убедить тебя что во всем виноват именно ты и никто другой, пусть даже ты и вытаскиваешь и ямы этих дурачков.  Ну удачи вам в покорении ребятки.)",-1,1,0

The thing is they're all 12 year olds with tourrettes and particularly ignorant mothers. The gaming society is so fanatic about numbers that they forget that criticism and praise are reflections of an individual's formed beliefs. That being said, Dota 2 is a terrible game, and that's not an opinion; it's the truth. Valve's fear of the number 3 has thrown them afar by pushing number 2's (yes, I did just say that, laugh it up) of all their other series. Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 and Half Life 2 as well as Half Life 2: Episode 2. But now they are doing it to games they don't originally own! Repetition is useful in debates and extremely rarely in games. A lesson Valve is eagerly forgetting to the point where Dota 2 doesn't even have multiple maps to change things up. I see it's up to the players to pose new situations; how inadvertently lethargic. I cannot comprehend how players can have over 3000 hours doing the same thing; let alone 5. To put this in today's terms; Dota 2 is so stupid your mum asked me what I was doing and when I replied 'I'm playing Defense of the Ancients' she freaked out believing that I was attempting to prevent her murder. I weep for future generations that, when asked to list 10 goods things about the 21st century, can only find numerous references to swag, Justin Bieber and the mindset that a large amount of players in a game means everyone in the whole world should enjoy it.

570,Dota 2,"DOTA 2 is the remake of the game that started the MOBA genre as a Warcraft III mod back in the early 2000's. With updated graphics, physics, voice work and animations there is a lot here for someone who played the original. That being said, for newcomers this probably isn't going to be a pleasant experience. DOTA 2 is notorious for having one of the worst communities in the digital world. Players are extremely toxic and many matches devolve into shouting matches and trolling instead of the intense 5v5 combat that they were designed to be. Another problem is the lack of region lock with allows people from different regions in the world to play on servers that are not close to them. This results in your team mates having to overcome several major obstacles which include; a language barrier, a cultural barrier, lag due to distance from the server, etc. You get the picture, in a game where teamwork is more important than individual skill it becomes impossible to actually work with your team resulting in extremely frustrating matches that are more frequent then the good ones. DOTA 2 also struggles from outdated graphics, and overly convoluted itemization options to differentiate its heroes from each other. Hero skills take a backseat to itemization in terms of importance and good luck exploring new builds outside of the current meta without being verbally assaulted by your team mates. In conclusion, I would recommend this game only to diehard fans of the original because it is quite neat to see how far the game has changed visually. Other than that I would direct MOBA newcomers to either League of Legends or SMITE which both offer new players with much better options for learning the game and avoiding negative experiences.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"As you can see, I only have some 45 hours played of this game so far, but I think I can make a safe judgement on the game based off of what I've played so far.  I played through an entire campaign with the dwarfs, and it had its moments, for sure. I enjoyed wiping out the greenskins, and I was genuinely frightened of chaos when they first appeared. I liked the gyrobombers, and nothing really came close to seeing an entire chaos warhound charge crumple under 4 squads of Irondrakes setting them on fire. The battles were genuinely fun, and it reminded me very much of the original table top game. So I enjoyed that bit, and it's ultimately what made me keep playing.  As the campaign wore on, though, and I realized how underwhelming chaos was, it came to a point where there was nothing left on the map but me, dwarves I hadn't assimilated yet, and the humans of Bretonnia and The Empire. My turns became nothing but cycling through the towns, managing what was being built, recruiting replacements for my 7 or 8 armies that were on the move, trying to make sure my two main quest-driven characters didn't get assassinated, and hitting 'next turn' a lot more then I really felt was necessary. After mopping up Barak Varr (leaving me with just 2 dwarf factions left to claim) I knew the game was pretty much a forgone conclusion, but I had to sit through it. It wasn't fun anymore, it was just tedious.  So I thought I'd try Chaos instead. Tried them out (got the expansion for free) and found that it was even more 'next turn' waiting, though the combat in battles was more fun due to having mounted units. Still, the waiting was awful. I'd camp after sacking something and it would take 4 minutes to get to a point where my army was safe enough to move on. There was no time-limit. No sense of urgency. It was just 'you know, meander on down south when you get a chance. Destroy the other chaos tribes, if you want. Who cares.' It also didn't feel like Chaos. I can't really put my finger on it, but the army didn't feel like a ravenous hungry mob of crazy chaos worshipers and demons. It felt like a regular army with chaos skins.  The game was fun for a bit, but the really 2 dimensional diplomacy (wiping out dwarfs was not what I signed up for as a dwarf), the long wait times between turns, the fact that you can't really play those other factions in campaign mode, the fact that the campaign victory conditions are just tedious, and the fact that chaos warriors (the faction) is just kinda meh... it means I can't really recommend this game unless it's on sale. It had its moments, but they came in between stretches of boredom or tedium. It's just not a very fleshed out game, by the feel of it, though it is bug free as far as I can tell and the battles are fun.   TL;DR The battles are fun, the campaign map is tedious, the DLC is not worth the money. Get it on sale if you get it at all.",-1,1,0

Limited factions, short main campaigns and low replayability had me putting this TW game on the shelf faster than any of the others I've played before.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"After logging many hours in this game, I would definitely recommend this to anyone whose computer can handle it. When I first heard of Planetside 2 from one of my friends, I had my doubts, but since the game was free to play, I decided to give it a try. I have to admit I am impressed. Planetside 2 is an anomaly among most genres, as there are few mmofps games out there. This is the only fps game I know that allows for multiplayer battles between hundreds of combatants. There are no bots in this game. Everything that moves is controlled by a player. In terms of scale, Planetside 2 cannot currently be matched by any other existing shooter.  Despite the fact that the game is free to play, it runs relatively smoothly. The game is still a work in progress, as SOE is continuously releasing new content, which means there is no shortage of new weapons and content to explore. The game can be a little rough around the edges. On several occasions, I've encountered some interesting bugs. Fortunately, SOE is usually quick in patching them.  While some people claim otherwise, it is possible to be very effective in this game without paying anything. There are in-game purchases, but they are mostly for cosmetic items, such as camo, decals, and armor styles. You can also buy weapons for anywhere from $2.50 to $7.00. Player performance upgrades such as nano-weave can not be purchased, but must by unlocked through gameplay, eliminating any pay-to-win aspects. While the prices for weapons are steep, the same weapons can also be unlocked via cert points, which are accumulated during gameplay. Using certs, weapons can cost anywhere between 100 and 1000 cert points to unlock. For novice players, this can be daunting. However, vetern players can easily crank out abouty 70 certs an hour. I was able to mass a decent arsenal through gameplay alone. Before you complain about the grind, know that you can just as effective at killing with the starting weapons, which include a pistol, assualt rifle, carbine, light machine gun, launcher, semi-auto sniper rifle (bolt-action for New Conglomerate players), and the default MAX weapons (varies from faction to faction). While it is not necessary to do so the first weapon I would recommend investing in (using certs) is a shotgun. however, recently, SOE added one to players inventories for free, limiting my suggestions to only a bolt-action sniper rifle and a smg. Of course, if using certs for weapons, be sure to first upgrade abilities and stamina before looking at guns.  Overall, I had a great experience with this game and highly recommend it. If you like fps games with massive battles between infantry, tanks, and aircraft, this game is for you. If not, its free. The only thing it will cost is time and hard drive space.",1,0,1

The game is funny for the first 10 hours, and then you realize: this is litterally the most boring game I think I've ever played. You may be thinking that this game is hilarious, but the reason simulators are funny is because they aren't intentionally ♥♥♥♥♥, but this one is. Even though it is enjoyable and you might get a few laughs out of it, the game is just dull.

You might like this game if:  You enjoy humorous games You don't need an objective to enjoy gameplay You enjoy sandbox games.  One of my favorite features is obtaining *goats*. Each time you collect a new goat, you can play as that goat by starting a fresh session. From double jump goat to penguins to jetpacks. Every time you start a game witha new goat its like a whole new adventure and there is a large variety of these findable goats too! :D Have fun!  This game has a lot of bugs, but they are bugs that only add humor to the game without breaking it. I actually enjoy the bugs immensely.

265930,Goat Simulator,"  Goat Nis Video Part 1 ~ At First Lick   [medavelvan.com]  When saw that there was a game called ‘Goat simulator’ on Steam, I smiled and I was immediately thankful that someone out there had the sense of humor and sufficient motivation to make a game with such an obstinant premise.  I almost bought it full price simply to support free-spirited developers like these; but I am happy that I refrained and waited for a sale. It’s a fun game, but not a good game.  Before playing ‘Goat Simulator’ I imagined the game in two flavors: either a realistic Goat Sim, where players would live the daily routine of a goat with normal goat missions: eat grass, escape fence, eat garden plants, evade farmer~ where the humor would arise from the realism of being a goat.  The second flavor would be an over-the- top, silly goat game with crazy game mechanics and wacky missions, ~ where the humor would be from the absurdity of it all. My first impression of ‘Goat Simulator’, as seen in  Goat Nis - Part One  [medavelvan.com]  confirmed that it was the latter:  ‘Goat Simulator’ is an over-the-top goat sim with wacky physics and unreasonable world interaction.  It is simply impossible to describe the level of absurdity present in every aspect of this game. A complete video review will be necessary in the near future when we have time to edit the highlights in our playthrough video.  In a nutshell, I recommend this game to gamers who like cheap sandbox games. This game is not an immersive rpg or GTA with goats, but it’s fun for $5 if you catch it during a Steam Sale.  ~Medavelvan  http://www.medavelvan.com ",1,0,1

I was excited to buy it for my PC. However, after it downloaded and said it was 'ready to play' I reached the launch menu and no matter what options I changed or reccomendations I followed I could not launch the game. I would press the PLAY button and the launch menu would disappear and the game wouldn't start. I was dismayed to find out that several other people were having this exact problem with little to no success in fixing it. I'm disappointed that nobody has patched this problem and that the game is even up for sale when a multitude of people are unable to even play it. In the matter of the game itself, it is an absolutely wonderful game. Sadly, the one on Steam is a ripoff and I would like my money back.",-1,0,0

265930,Goat Simulator,"Goat Simulator was a good game when I played on Mac. Now, for me to consider to redownload it or not, I would pick no.   Mac has been known to be a bad system to play games on, yet my Mac can play most of the Valve games and some third-party games, like this one. Now I play mostly on Windows now, I said no to downloading this again.  Firstly, this game is riddled with glitches. This is a complete game, not Early Access. I guess it is supposed to make the game funnier.   Which leads to my second point. This game tries very hard to be funny. It just simply is not. It relies heavily on pop culture references and puns for jokes which are very poor and unfunny.  The physics in this game are absolutely horrific. When people get hit by cars, they lie there for a second, and get back up like nothing ever happened. Same with the goat. People get stuck in walls, the goats head flaps wildly, heads extend towards the sky, the tongue of the goat shoots into outer space for no reason at all, and everything explodes and shoots everywhere with one single tap. Also, if benches are pushed away, people float in the air.  The community is the only saving grace, EXCEPT I COULD NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING!  Finally, the graphics. These graphics are good, very good, IF THIS WAS RELEASED IN 2004! Textures look murky, the goat looks like an early PS3 model, and people look unpolished. This looks like a PS2 game.  Forgot to mention the fireworks. No control over them, they will just shoot you off in a random direction.  Achievements were the worst. Relied on pop culture references, but at least POSTAL 2 did it right, and that was from 2003!   A Goat Simulator plush was not needed.  Music is just a looped synth beat that gets annoying after at least 10 minutes.  I was bored with this game after at least 10 minutes.  If you want it, get it on sale for dirt cheap. Whatever you do, avoid this game at all costs on regular price.  3 out of 10",-1,0,0

Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that its DLC because it came with rhe pre-order and so its obviously already written into the game.   the second DLC which came out a few weeks after release (what a coincidence :^) ) has blood and gore.

But if you like playing games more than just watching some small dots run around on some of the more boaring looking games boards in the most bland colors then you just found the holy grail of games.   If you are like most gamers of an age to remember how awesome the original total war gamesare, then you will find yourself asking didnt the Total War games used to be fun?   Maybe its the scale of the game, ie... to far pulled back to see the fights or maybe its how you never seem to get attached to any generals (you can not custom make them) or even how boaring the fighting looks now... possibly the pace?  Whatever it is this game has you hitting auto-battle 3 fights into the story. That is not good. Everything outside of the battles is just clicking through menues.   My only hope for this game is the intense release plans for new units, new heros, new armies etc.. they claim to have planned. although i wonder how much of it was just cut from the original game to be released as DLC.   oh and big con: no skaven. Thats one race that would have done really well with this game engine. lots of big cannons, doomwheels, rat ogres...   additional thoughts:  Fixed starting areas seems lore friendly but means you really only get a few towns to start in.

Wait for a sale since they are being so greedy. The DLC is not worth the cost and is just plain greedy, the blood and gore is really cheesy and over exaggerated, not to mention it shouldn't be paid for in the first place. The fact that they already have so many DLC's is just ridiculous, they should have mostly been free or much cheaper.  Beast men are expensive and boring, mostly do to the copy-paste mechanics.  The AI mechanics and tactics could be much better and are really dull, the fighting animations are barely improved, units take turns hitting eachother instead of having fluid combat, I really think they could have done better if they tried.   UNIT ABILITIES - They are gone.... just gone... except for hero units... why? this is so dumbed down it's made the combat very boring... just flank, that's the only tactic to do, flank and match up spears against large enemies and that's it, no actual tactics anymore.  The agents/heroes are kind of fun at first, it's cool having heroes fight on the battlefield, but using them on the campaign map is very very very boring.   Yes I've put in over a hundred hours into this, the game is very charming at first, but I'm just not having as much fun with is as I had in Shogun 2, which i've put in just over 500 hours.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Currently, I'm liking this game. This is probably one of the better works from Total War series in recent years. However, at the very beginning of the game, I've already felt the lack of units variety and playable factions compared with Shogun 2.  Also, no more avatar conquest makes me very sad. Imagine avatar conquest was in this game, you're able to customize your own character and leveling him/her up like a RPG, fight a random opponent online with your friends or fight against AI, or putting in unique story/lore related missions/quests like King Arthur. Warhammer is born to be perfect with avatar conquest, and I don't know why the hell they decided not to put that into the game.   I understand DLC is part of Total War frenchise now. But, at the very ♥♥♥♥ing least give us a ♥♥♥♥ing FULL game without ripping out basic contents. DLC meant to create new things to the game, not cutting exsisting content out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

Very disappointing was looking for top AAA game with heavily astonishing graphics.  As for game play - same Rome II - little bit more polished on the edges but I see no much improvement from the previous disaster.  I like the interface a lot - neat, clean, theme related, beautiful easy to use and eye easy as well. Price is too much for this game - even The Wither III had it lower at release and its top notch game with magnificent visual and graphical appeal.

It's a free to play with a pay to win feel. Now no one enjoys pay to win and I mean nobody, it's not rewarding and it causes F2P'ers to feel very weak and useless. Your base guns are shlock, you get paired up with enemies millions of times more experienced or armed than you are. It isn't fun unless you're goofing around with friends and/or drunk out of your mind.

Just look up a video or two and see what you want to spend your points upgrading, and pick a role and stick with it for at least [the standard amount of time that you would typically try to do something in a game.] Don't play an Engineer for 10 minutes, repair a vehicle without ever getting in one yourself and then say 'this isn't for me,' then switch to Infiltrator, get sniped in the face while trying to line up a shot of your own, and then quit. You will understand if you just give it a day or two. There's a learning curve, which is something to admire. There is no winning gear--your skill and adapatibility will determine whether you conquer the map or not. It's free, what do you have to lose, besides some of your time?

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I am a long time fan of the Total War series begenning with the first Shogun sixteen years ago. I own every Total war with the exception of Atilla( even having purchased Napoleon despite the fact that it was originally advertised as a free LC for purchasers of Empire because of the terrible condition Empire was released in). In that last seven years fifteen total war games and sizable expansions have been released ( one of them being a free LC I believe as I don't remember buying the Imperator Augustus DLC to Rome 2. Of those I own only two were released in a usable fashion, Shogun 2 and Warhammer. While they still had issues they were not overwhelmingly noticable or impactful to gameplay.  So given the track record Warhammer was a last attempt with this company- and by god the early game in particular and the mid game as well are good! The late game suffers and this is definitly a Total War light experience with several core and complicated mechanics removed (presumably) to make the game more accessible.   Despite the positives which I can laud for this game I cannot bring myself to reccomend the game to others. I made a mistake in preordering this game. The company is time and again showing a general distrust and ineptitude that I can no longer forgive.   This brings me to my final note and the reason why I wrote this review- The dlc strategy of CA / GamesWorkshop.  The game released with a faction that had to be paid to use- on top of pricing the game at 60 U.S. Said faction (Chaos) is pretty lackluster as a horde faction with a lacking campaign that results in a hundred turns( or as high as two hundred) doing basically nothing preparing to invade the world at large with ai mechanics for the subjugated factions being... unpolished. This can be reduced by playing on a low difficulty but that should not be a neccesity for a faction.  Soon to release will be another DLC faction- A horde faction advertised as having unique mechanics- namely the greenskin/dwarf underway reskinned and no horde infighting. Amazing. A slew of reskinned chaos units ( some identical ) and an improvement to how the horde handles sacking and looting settlements which should have been included in the Chaos release. For 20 U.S. This is an utter dissapointment for me 1/3rd the price of the game within a scant two months after release for a reskin of an already dlc horde faction. Combined the two dlc factions ( forming fully 50 percent of the initial game race options) will cost 50 percent of the original asking price. 90 Dollars to play the game at full two months after release? Are you kidding me?  I am done CA - You have lost me as a consumer of your product - maybe MAYBE if in some steam sale they are reasonably priced I will go for it.  I find it much more likely that the combination of a poor sales strategy and customer interaction will result in a dwindling community- even those who would buy the game cheap because they enjoyed the experience of a stolen version will not be touching this mess.

The only complaint I have is the co-op mission glitches that make it hard to invite your friends sometimes. With that in mind, the story itself is very entertaining and well put together. In a way, I would like to say the game is realistic, because once you zone out after playing it for a few hours, you get really intense and into it. The graphics are pretty great a good majority of the time, but my laptop isn't exactly prepared for me to have all the graphics up in 'high'.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Before reading: this review is more of a neutral review than a not recommended review (which they should add) because I can't recommend it but it isn't garbage.   I decided to buy it because almost everyone I know told me that it's the best horror game ever. I'll admit it's scary the first time you play it because you don't know when the jumpscares are coming and if they're scary, but then after the first couple of them you realize it's just the noise that makes you jump and the actual jumpscares aren't scary, it turns into a strategy game. You can see if a jumpscare is coming if   'it's me' flashes on the security tablet thingy or if the power is off and if you see eyes flashing and hear music  . After the first two or three levels it starts to become boring (play in bursts?). There was something I liked about the vague ending though.   In conclusion, it's not bad, but not good either. It isn't really that scary to me, more adrenaline-rushing when I need to close the door fast (which needs power to close?!), so if you like strategy games with horror elements or something, then this is the game for you.   and for the love of  god ...

Combat is very smooth and organized. Units stay in formation and there arent any mosh pits like rome 2. Performance is way better than Rome 2 despite it having way better graphics than it.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is a first (or third) person slasher game which consists of 2 teams: Agatha Knights and Mason Order. There are 4 classes to choose from: Archer (long range, low hp), Man at Arms (ability to dodge, low hp), Vanguard (uses heavy weapons and can execute a sprint attack with high damage, medium hp) and Knight (uses high damaging weapons at the cost of speed, high hp).  The game has a variety of game modes including: Free-for-all, Team Deathmatch, Team objective (best mode), Last Team Standing and King of the Hill. These game modes are very fun and can keep you entertained for hours. Just to note that Team Objective and King of the Hill matches can last a long time (30+ minutes).  The combat is satisfying with a variety of attacks to choose: slash, stab and overhead. You are able to parry (block) but at the cost of stamina. You will also loose stamina if you miss an attack or kick (breaks an enemies block). These mechanics do work well but could do with some tweaking.  Overall I do really like this game and can easily spend a few hours playing. I very much reccomend this game, although it can be a bit buggy. Make sure your PC is capable of running it, as laptops will suffer even at lower settings (but can still be playable).",1,0,1

I usually get killed in the middle of trying to get a bead on the person who just head-shotted me. Having said all of that, and not having spent that much time with this game, I can confidently say that this is a good one. The visuals are pleasing and the interface is intuitive. To a noob like me, things can be a little overwhelming at first, but if you are fortunate enough to have a buddy who is a regular player to show you the ropes, it will greatly ease your introduction into the vast battleground in the game world. I like the use of vehicles as well as the character classes, though it does put me off that you can come back as a different class every time you die and respawn. I prefer a certain amount of investment and commitment in the class or role that I play.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Pros:  This game is a great game and has lots of good features and implements. Despite having lots of microtransactions and such it is still possible to have a good time without spending a dime. Most stuff such as health packs, weapon upgrades, etc can be earned through getting certs, which you get when you level up and get kills.  Cons:  Despite being able to earn certs, it is a hard and long process to earn enough certs to buy anything usefull in the shop. The game emphasizes more on spending your hard earned cash rather than actually earning it, but the fact that you can still earn items for free is great considering that the game is free, so that can be overlooked. The game has a very lackluster 'tutorial' that leaves scratching your head at how the game is even, and at times some functions in the game such as the lattice network and how each building functions to your faction can be confusing, but this is one of those games you'd figure out as you much like I did.   I'm not for FPS games, but I still had fun with this one even though i'm broke and I suck balls at it. I recommend this to all who read this review, which is probably nobody. ",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,The warhammer game I have been waiting for since I started the hobby 10 years ago. Total war is a perfect combination and I am am really impressed by the detail of the world that has been created. If Creative can go full throttle on the story cutscenes and make some beautifully gritty CGI cutscenes that would be even better! The game is also lacking a punch in terms of gritty Ness that the Warhammer world is known for - where's the gore and blood and Dark humour? Otherwise a fantastic game that I'm sure I'll spend many more hours getting into.,1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is one of the best games we've seen lately. Great fps mechanics, GORGEOUS graphics, amazing characters, good story line, and lots and lots of fun.  The islands act a very fun sandbox where you can just roam around and adventure. The amazing visuals make explorations extremely enjoyable, and there are lots of side missions to do while you roam.   The bad? No game is perfect and FC3 does have some defects. The non-story character models are lame and there is only a handful of them, attack of the clones much? Although this is can be a great sandbox game, you will eventually run out of outposts to capture. (This was remedied by adding an option to reset all outposts which is great). The crafting is an amazing feature but it is actually very shallow. A more in-depth crafting system would have made the game that much more fun. The economy in general is gimmicky, new guns and mods can be acquired rather easily.   Overall this is an outstanding game and worth every sacond of your precious game time.   9/10.   ",1,0,1

I didnt fire a shot. Best outpost raid EVER!   Ability to use a Tiger by accident! 10/10",1,0,1
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I wanted to take a moment to state that this game has its ups and its downs. Overall I would say the multiplayer is glitchy yet addictingly fun (Always fun to yell AAAAGAAAATHAAAAA when running in there). The weapon variety is lacking and any server lag can make the game nearly impossible to play legitly without just swinging wildly. I host my own server with my friends and face bots when we want to have a nice day of carnage. I just wish that the server software had more options and possibly more spawn-able bots (or difficulty levels on them)  A few more details:  The game is 100% multiplayer and due to the nature of the game you tend to get a good deal of people frustrated at each other with at least 1-2 attempts to kick a player every match. Although the controls are rather simple there are a good number of moments where the reach of a weapon isn't clear nor are the enemy's 'telegraphed movements' acurately portrayed so you never really know who is swingging their weapon first and if you're in range of the hit. On that same note, be prepared to be yelled at as friendly fire is a common theme in the game as well as attempts at stealing kills. I can't count how many times I've been fighting a guy one-on-one only to have a teammate run in there lobbing off my head in an attempt to steal my thunder. Yes, you can kick someone for friendly fire (its a nice touch that they include the amount of damage dealt to teammates in the voting window) but I've had matches where people are voted to be kicked due to friendly fire that was clearly on accident and let's be frank here- when a skirmish happens EVERYONE has a little friendly fire.  On the note of multiplayer- the different game modes are refreshing. It's great to go from a free-for-all mass chaos match to an object oriented map or a team battle to a duel arena. The variety is nice but the game feels like it could use more support from the developers- the content is lacking for the price tag and you would think there would be more weapon variety or at least some more 'unlockables' or something a little 'flashy to earn'.  Final notes:  The game is a lot of fun to play but keep in mind that the $25 price tag is a little steep given the amount of content you receive. If the game is on sale for $10 or under however- pick it up and enjoy a weekend of bloody murders!",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I have tried playing this game on several occasions. In none of those occasions have I ever had fun. This is, by far, the most unbalanced, most new-user-unfriendly, un-fun pile of garbage I have ever played. Not only is its one goal to basically force you into buying their worthless microtransactions, but it also punishes you for trying to use hard work to upgrade your own stuff to at least match the unstoppable warlords you constantly face. Teamwork is made useless by invincible vehicles that cannot be harmed, and even if you do win it's because you had more vehicles or Max classes than the other enemy. What are Maxes? They're basically a purchasable class with so much armor and weaponry that shooting at one is like trying to dig a hole through prison with your bare hands.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I'm a former huge fan of WARHAMMER table strategy game (before Games Warkshop butchered it) that enjoyed to play a bit of Total War games like Shogun and Rome.  I recommand this game to any warhammer fan that looks for some epic looking battle and doesn't want to paint/buy a sh*tload of miniatures. This game is more similar to Warhammer than a Total War game.  Here my list of Pros and Cons about this game:  PROS:  -Awesome map graphics and units models/movements and sounds  -Feels like Warhammer  -The majority of your beloved Heroes/Champions/Units are there and they kick a*ses  -The factions are unique and different in the economy management, playstyle, campaign movement and tecnology tree  -The magic is cool and powerful but not game breaking in the Campaign Mode  -They promised that ALL the factions will be added through DLC and expansions  -Developers are constantly working on the game  -Cool siege battles: you put units on the walls and you will fight up there, outside the walls and inside the city, siege battles are also rather fast and intense  -GAME IS FULL MODDABLE: you don't like something about the gameplay? No problem, 5 min into the Steam Workshop and you will find what you need and MORE (over 1900 MODS AVAILABLE)  CONS:  -If you plan to get all the factions i suggest you to wait for some discounts or this game will cost you A LOT  -4 playable Factions in the base game: Empire, Dwarfs, Vampire Counts and Greenskins. If your favourite factions aren't released yet the game becomes boring after some time (i main Wood Elves and i like to get Bretonnia, Khemri, Lizardman, Chaos Dwarfs and are not released yet)  -Non Campaign PvP is terrible: No army restriction except money, you will see any kind of cheese/unbalanced army compositions. Extremely unfun to play for a game mode that is the CORE of WARHAMMER. It's sad because is easy to solve this problem by just introducing the tabl game army restrictions  -Lack of siege maps diversity, mechanically speaking they are similar, always fight behind similar walls, aesthetically they looks different and are full of details  I DO RECOMAND THIS GAME BUT BE CAREFUL:  1-if you are a HUGE Total War fan this game is more focused on the battles and the other aspects are semplified (economy, diplomacy, agents) if compared to the others Total War games.  2-if your favourite Warhammer factions are not released you might wanna consider to wait until they are out instead of buy the game and than complain about 'lack of content'.",1,0,1

It is definitly not worth $25 and has a suprising lack of content.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Its a good game dont get me wrong but it has some issues with the DLC pricing and stuff like that. Like why do i have to pay for blood when the game should probably come with it. The same for each race costing 20 US when they come out. Say I buy each race that comes out like beastmen, skaven, wood elves, high elves, dark elves, tomb king, chaos daemons, ogre kingdoms, lizardmen and possibly other factions like cathay and they all cost 20 US EACH. I have now spent a lot of money to get the Full Experience of the game when i should only buy one or a few expansions that come with a few races just like dawn of war or warcraft.. Look at this way there are 9 races that still aren't out yet and plus beastmen which just came out so you are paying about 200 US dollars to get 10 races which is a lot of money spent on one game, Assuming every race is going to cost approximately 20 US each. So should you buy this well if u love warhammer or and total war sure why not but if u dont but would generally like to play a new RTS then maybe wait a year or two until Sega and CA pull their head out and lower the price of each race to half the current price Or release several races at a time as expansions like Warhammer dawn of war or Warcraft for 30 US Dollar for one expansion at a time.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: Warhammer is a pretty good game. I've had fun playing it, and I keep playing it a bit now and again. I've also bought all the DLC.

I lost a 120 turn game between patches.  - When the game patches, it clones the entire game. This means that on an HDD it can take upwards of an hour, and on an SSD you need at least 25gig of free space.  - I paid $25 for the Beastment DLC which had pretty much copy and paste Ork mechanics. Lazy, lazy gameplay development for an expensive DLC  - I get HUGE frame drops whenever there are undead zombies on screen.  - I've had to find about 8 quality of life mods just to make the game playable and fun. Speed boosts in friendly territory (or you just get kited indefinitely. I was so mad when i manoeuvred 2 armies to corner a raiding army and they just ♥♥♥♥ed off in boats.) Camera mods, enemy unit composition mods (or they just kite you for days with cavalry archers). Mods to make heroes more fun. Just basic things that should have been in the game.  - Incredibly lazy game design for dificulty levels. Harder level AI simply cheats - more gold, better stats in game, increased morale etc. They don't play any differently, as in, they don't employ better tactics.

265930,Goat Simulator,"PROS: A smallish map with a LOT to explore and the goals make the game more than just a mess-around game (although it really is that in the first place) and the fact that it is supposed to be buggy makes the game that much more hilarious. With the golden goat trophies this game makes my day. You can become [SPOILER ALERT]    a flipping sperm whale and flop around the map or even an alien from Sanctum 2 (it kinda looks like a bug giraffe thing)   . There are many other goats you can be if you collect enough golden goat statues. This game even has workshop support, so if you get bored of the normal goats or the original map or even just want more abilities for custom games, then you can get an item from the workshop or make your own. For such a small map, the place is flipping packed with easter eggs (such as the golden goat trophies) and, my favorite, a cool robot dude in a storage crate held up by the crane and [SPOILER ALERT]    If you get certain achievments you can actually be the robot!    And on the side, there are many references to other games like Coffee Stain Studio's game Sanctum 2 and Flappy bird.  CONS: The fact that they are only removing bugs that crash the game means that there will always be bugs. Always. Sometimes I find myself getting stuck on a rock and glitching underground. I still would like the bugs there but some of them are just plain irritating. The game also requires a pretty good graphics card, so make sure your computer isn't a potato and the game doesn't eat your computer. I had to turn my settings all the way down and only then did most of the lag go away. Another thing is that the Flappy Bird game (Flappy Goat) is the most rage inducing thing in the ENTIRE game. To unlock the achievment for the Flappy Goat you needed to score ten and my high score is like six. And the reason it is hard is because the hitbox of the goat is bigger than the goat itself so you end up hitting something when it looks like you didn't. And with some of the goats like the space goat for example, its a lot harder to know where your headbutting because you dont hit where your head goes, you hit right in front of you so it kinda seems a bit akward, but hopefully they will fix it. The game is still in development so all the bad stuff right now will probably be fixed in the future and new stuff will be added.   Overall I give this game a 11/10. Apart from the bugs which they are never going to fix (which isn't really that bad) and some akward hitboxes this game is virtual gold. Mostly because the bad and irritating things about this game don't bother me as much as it would with other people. If you are looking for a good laugh, a goat with jelly legs, and a cool game to play with your friends at home    (They are planning to add local co-op)    then this is the game for you!*   *This game is Chuck Norris approved",1,0,1

I just wanted to warn other low end computer users like me that this game doesn't work well at all unless you have a bit of power to your system. This might seem like a 'No sh*t Sherlock' observation, however the same requirement specs in other games sometimes runs fine on my system, however that was not the case with this one. I also came across the problem with my logitech controller that happens often with steam games, where my controls are all wonky. 'Up goes down, the action buttons are random' I don't know why this happens with steam games. Some accept it, others don't. The same game not from steam will work fine, but the steam version won't. (Figured this out thanks to the humble bundle, deciding I wanted the acheivments after realizing I had a choice over what version of the game to get) Anyway, wasn't sure if I should give this a thumbs down, but since I had to choose one and giving a thumbs up to something I couldn't get working didn't seem fair.

Once you touch this game, it kinda draws you in and keep you playing, which will devour so much of your time, and it is very hard to get out of that.  Why it is depressing? The community is the biggest reason, you will get flamed, cursed and reported for the mistake that you make by other players. As a result, you will develop into a person who becomes very salty(Classic exmaple EG.PPD) and rage easily.  And you get to play with Peruvian!! They are the worse teammates that you can have. They like to play on us server from Peru with more than 100ping, no thought they are bad, Since this is a team game, they are lack of teamwork (AFK farming) and communication ('jajajaja' is what they talk). They give out easily and often result into a rage quit. I really hope Valve could do something about this, maybe regional lock-out so they could not enter us serve.

I always knew this game had UI issues, but once you get hands on and think: 'Oh it is 2016, it should be fully working' NOPE! Odd little things and arros to click, like the 'download' symbol you see, but inversed, and shown durring a loading player state like...I sit there and think...'What will happen if I click that? Explodeth the game??? Instant gold?....and you hover the mouse over andddd nope...won't touch it'.... stuff like this ALL OVER!   Make matters worse, so you have this giant menu to look at heros...ok, animated little thumb files...you click in, little run down, but no 'see what they can do' just a button that offers you a demo round with them like what??? so all that effort into a making a aniamted thumbs but what COUNTS! WHAT REALLY COUNTS is this shove in load a new screen sort of presentation? OHHHH IT GET'S WORSE!   So go in to play: I select my character, choose the game mode (which is confusing as fewk, I just chose : 'All' which makes you think you are about to queue up for ALL the modes availabe, but now it just means 'all characters available' as opposed to 'just 3 at random' mode....you see it is brain dumbing down UI choices that make me think : 'Why do people call this the 'smart mans MOBA' over LoL? Lol is actually WAY more logically put together than this POS.  So I ge my match fired up in under a minute. And then....WE CHOSE AGAIN heroes...Wait wait wait, oh and get this, it is not, of course, USER INTERFACE FRIENDLY! You have this Windows 8 / MAC interface rip off window selection of characters... you know, like a bar of icons to sift through like a whirly book...so I now, as a new player, I have to RESWIFT through all these champions...You see before, on a one page lay out, it is organized by FORCE - Agility - MAGIC heroes (and you have to click into each one to see which one is carry, distance etc... just bad), but here it is nothing...just all sloppily thown into this whirly book icon thing...so I panic since the match is about to start and timer counting down, I start franitcally swifting through...oh god who was it again???? What did I want? Oh look, that one looks cool...no, stay on target.... AH HA! FOUND IT! WHEWWWW lock it in....  And now another 2 min wait for...I don't know what...but in the end about the same waiting time as LOL to fire up. So no major issues...  In game....ok...oh god...*Insert massive rant on the horrid UI. Poor camera. Bad map movement*. WHAT? I pressed C for camera hoping it locks me in place, but NOooooo I activated a pack donkey....folks...I kid you not. My character straight up goes STATIC, and I became a pack donkey.... DONT EVER PRESS C!   So then back to game once I got that straightened up. I follow my zerglings to the nearest tower, some guy is killing my zergies behind the tower, ok, I start whacking the tower and some one that was 100% invisible unlcoaks, and 2 shots my 'Tank assassin' guy (he being a regular assassin, some kind of shark with invisibiliy)....

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Hello Everybody, I am an experienced Total war player and Super fan, I started with Medieval 2 and loved it, and loved every single game since. Not this one though. The first time I attacked a village and realised there were no longer village battles but just a regular land battle like any other, I knew this game had gotten dumbed down and was treated very lazily. Why else would they not have village battles except for being too lazy to implement them, or just plain rushing the game. Also I hate the fact that a hero and an agent, if put in the army, takes an entire slot in your 20 stack army, so not only do you have less units and soldiers than previous games to start, you lose every single soldier that would normally be in your generals unit, and if you take an agent you lose another unit of soldiers. I could go on and on about the mistakes in this game, but I will not because others are doing so, this game is just a huge pile of mistakes, and utterly pales in comparison to previous titles. This game, like many others, tries to please more and more people after each title, so with trying to please more and more people, they lose the original greatness that this franchise is with each new release of a title.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"They say this game is skyrim with guns, HA! im not even a fan of skyrim but if your a complacent dimwit with no concept of how these games are constructed read no further and go ahead and | have your happy meal served to you, have you hand held and walked through every mundane step of this total waist of hard drive space. For a start skyrim like all of bethesda's masterpieces is loaded with an unthamomable veriaty of intreguing areas, NPCs, and side quests that lure you, seduce you willingly away from the main story path time and again and have you whiling away countless hours wondering whats round the next corner carefully choosing who you will side with, who you will or will not help, while this game does the exact ♥♥♥♥ing opposite, beyond the primary story and a pitifull bounty board this game offers little more than farming for crafting material. Yes you can re activate towers, take over shanty towns and every single one of them is near identical and makes itself so easy a monky could be trained to do it but are more like obsticals designed to prolong your play-through time than, there is NO dialogue choices, NO path choices, the quests themselves offer NO choices in terms of order and rout, and throughout the game your option is either to fight head on, or sneak. It may be an open free roaming map but you're simply going in strait lines from one linier dungeon to another one at a time following the most utterly ♥♥♥♥ing predictable storyline iv ever seen in a game like this one. even the gunplay is just tailered to the average child who grew up played you know what of duty. but all this i could forgive ALL OF IT, if only the AIs wernt so utterly stupid, they will either rush you or stand slowly shooting at you maybe tossing the occaisional nade. The wildlife aspect is obviousely a random script event but even with its most random ilussion is notyhing more than an gimmick to make the world seem alittle more alive but really its just saying spawn animal here, spawn pirates there, animal force target pirates and places that infront of you. even the pirate jeeps are limited to half the speed of other vehicals obviousely to prevent them from chasing you too far, WHY? why cant they chase me to the end of the map? that would be 1 interesting aspect of the gameplay, 1 purpose for it being in a sandbox map and not just a platform game. Yes i can see the apeal if you like pretty shooters, but to compare any aspect of this game to skyrim is absurd its more like xcrash bandicoot with guns and not in a good way. really I play MMOs that are less repetative and more interesting than this over produced soap oprah and thats speaking from a single player standing point, I could go on.  TLDR: you go in a strait line from one narrow linier quest to another, one at a time, with a couple of gimmicks and repetetive completionist quests along the way. with the dumbest and most predictable AIs youl ever see, and thats being KIND",-1,0,0

265930,Goat Simulator,"It's a fun game but the vanilla version is really lacking. It has very little content and could benefit a lot from more maps, game modes or just more things to do in general. I understand the developers want to benefit from all the work they put into the DLCs but as I said the vanilla game has very little content and often than not leaves you pretty bored after playing the game for a little while. It would be nice if they could update the vanilla game with more content instead of passing it of as DLC. I think Goat Simulator has a lot of potential and could possibly become one of the most fun crash course/sandbox games on steam if it wasn't so lacking.  I'm recommending it because despite what I said, the game is fun even though the fun doesn't last very long.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"**EDIT on 08JAN15**  TLDR: Never chatted. Team was wiped by a superior team. Whiney player blamed the mute (me), I get reported. Get 7 games LP for doing nothing wrong. ♥♥♥♥. This. Community.   DO NOT PLAY.   Yes, I don't recommend this game but I continue to play it and this game has the most logged hours out of my entire library BY FAR. Legit playing hours. Not AFKing at the main menu. So, take what I say in weight of gold.  I'm addicted to this game because yes, down deep, it has everything I look for in a game when it comes to competitiveness, strategy, RPG mixes and just its gameplay overall. So it's addicting. I keep coming back to it besides the fact it is the only game my entire life that gets me so angry I punch my desk leaving a gaping hole through the wood. Real wood. My hand is still recovering.  Today, I'm playing a ranked game. My team is getting horribly wooped and it's just a cascade failure. We were able to make some comebacks here and there but never enough to catch up and make a real change in the pace of the game. We were screwed.  Now, I'm muted. On my 3rd 165 hour comms ban in a row. Because people don't like it when others don't appreciate being called internet words we've heard and then some when said person is completely ignorant or wrong in what he said. Mind you, simply ignoring these people doesn't work. I'll get to that in a second.  So, because I'm muted I cannot say anything beyond provided phrases in the chat wheel related to gameplay. Like, attack or get back. So, the entire game this nightstalker is blaming me for our ♥♥♥ whooping. Apparently, it's because I didn't buy a blink before 23 minutes. Mind you, that's because I couldnt save 2.3k for the damn item because every time I get 60% or more towards it we'd have a team fight and we'd get destroyed. If there wasn't a team fight I couldn't find farm because the other carries were taking it or the lanes were too pushed out I'd get ganked. Yet, the simple fact me (axe) did not have blink is the reason why we lost with over 20 kills down. So, the majority of the game he is whining in chat to have me reported because 'axe is ♥♥♥♥'  We lost. Whatever. I go reqeueu for ranked and all of a sudden it stops a couple of minutes in and I get rewarded 7 mando games in Low Piority. Oh ghee. Perfect example of the community in DOTA2. Screwed if you defend urself in chat. Screwed if you dont. I have never felt such strong desire to strangle someone in my life before I discovered Dota2. I truly wish I never let myself get into the MOBA genre of gameplay. It's too addicting and not worth the stress. Maybe I'll get more self control and play this game less -- of which I do but I think it will be another year before I'm done playing completely.     ____ Horrible community ___ Some of the worst you'll find in online gaming. With how unforgiving and hypercompetitive the gameplay of DOTA2 is having a troll or just even a inexperienced teammate will ruin the game. Once your team has gone so far beyond the point of a comeback in the match, the fact that there is a lack of a surrender feature like the one found in League of Legends guarantees that you will be forced to waste 30-60 minutes of your life in a slow, painful defeat. There's no forgiving nature both from the game or the majority of players if you make mistakes or feed the enemy team and etc. You will likely be ignored or yelled at with various insults if trying to direct (or as DOTA2 community rankings describe it as 'leadership') your team with advice.  ____ Poor &amp; Unfair MMR System ____ The current MMR system is simply a win or loss additive. You win, +25 points. You lost, -25 points. No account for the average MMR of your team against the opposing team. No account for the split between MMRs. Nothing like that.   You can be doing everything right with your character and his role in the match for your team and still have a crushing defeat because of various factors. A lot of these factors are part of the game or any competitive match for that matter, true. However the game demands a lot of you depending on your role in the match. If you fulfill what's required - or rather expected - there is no reward. I have been in countless games both as a carry or support role and have done everything I can and more to push the game in our favor of victory and still lost. This has been both because the other team was better or there were trolls, noobs or inexperienced players on my team.   This system keeps you in an endless rut of bad game after bad game. This is because the lower your MMR drops so does the quality of players you will be matched with. I was just under 3k MMR but have continually dropped down to the point where it's rare to have a good game. I don't mind losing if it was a fun, competitive game. But this ties into the community alot where you have no motivation to keep palying right if there's no reward for it.   -- Addicting Gameplay. Seriously... look at my hours. I hate the players yet I keep going back. What does that say?",-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"I love this game.  I've played both Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3, and there's something about Fallout 3 that just appeals to me much more than New Vegas.  I love the atmosphere in this game, the devastation of the nuclear war really sets its tone to the map covered with ghouls, there's abomination creatures such as Radscorpion and big ♥♥♥ ants.  Whats missing from Fallout 3 is the combat, a lot of the weapons are very inaccurate, such as assault rifles, hunting rifle, laser rifle and all the pistols besides the magnum if you scope.. And that doesn't appeal to me, because I like accuracy weapons, feeling like i'm in control instead of a random spread cone.  You can't use iron sights in this game either, which feels like it should have been there.  The quests are overall fun if you read the messages on computers that goes along with these quests and if you take time to explore and look for hidden loot.  This is the best Fallout in my opinion, but I don't think its better than Skyrim.  Remember that you can mod the sh*t outta this game, so you can eliminate many of these drawbacks.

The campaign map feels a bit cut back compared to Attila and Rome II. No governers, family tree, can't see the buildings you've constructed in settlements, less buildings to choose from, and settlement battles don't actually take place in the settlement (except for walled cities) - they happen in a field with the settlement in view behind the battle. These are fairly minor things however, and don't impact the game TOO much. More so minor gripes on my behalf :P  But what is lacking on the campaign map is made up in the battles. Units have good weight, larger variety of units to choose from, more complex than 'paper-scissors-rock' etc. The new Lords and Wizard characters make a good addition as well.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"600+ Hours and I still feel like this game could've been better than what it is right now. It's filled with people who exploit the combat system [like me] and reckless noobs who spam LMB. Feinting is a good way to fight but it has been deemed a psycopathic behavior. I know the competitive duelers do it but I'm no fan of feinting. The community is ♥♥♥♥, I guarantee you that. Probably one out of every 500 players is actually helpful while the rest always talk ♥♥♥♥ about each other. Even when you lose a fight against a guy, a usual 'gf' will be uttered but no... the opponent will call you out and say how bad you are. I've been through those so many times it's not even funny. There is no chivalry in this game. 90% of a server's chat history is mainly people dissing each other or politics. The game isn't fun anymore. TDM used to be great when people worked together but now it's segregated to those tryhards, teamkillers, and archers who think sniping from 1000 miles away is still a good idea. There is also a steep learning curve as others have mentioned but it takes a LOOOOOOOONG time to get as skilled as the players you see in the duel servers. The combat is mediocre and is nowhere from realistic. Everything is always split second or drags and feints, sometimes it really is hard to read the ripostes and feints on particular weapons like the holy water sprinkler but that's just due to my lack of judgement. The dev team's updates are lackluster and do small updates at a time rather than large ones. And within those small updates it really hinders gameplay performance at times but I really do approve of finally being able to kick a person on a flight of stairs [and it only took them 3 years to fix that?]. This game always go on sales so don't buy this game at its original price.  I'd still play M&amp;B Warband over this game over any day. And I'm expecting Bannerlord and Mordhau to come out ASAP so I can finally put an end to this burden of a game I play.   So in the short run, if you really want to play this game, go ahead, by all means. But there will be better upcoming indie titles like the ones I mentioned earlier. Just mind the toxic community and expect to get your ♥♥♥ kicked within 3 seconds if you're a new person.",-1,0,0

The marriage of Total War and Warhammer is a marriage made in heavan. It would be good if they could get the Warhammer 40,000 license too as the Total War engine would work well with that also. Heres hoping.   My only gripe is that unlike the early Total War games they seem to release a half finished game and then charge you a lot of money for the remaining hallf.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"What is this unoptimized mess of a game?!  Low fps on great computers - Check Combat bug exploits - Check Uncaring team to fix all that - Check Toxic community - Check  What. The HELL. Is this?! I bought this game thinking that if Age of Chivalry mod was good - then this game would be even better. Dear god was I wrong.  To go into some detail - the biggest offset is that it runs like a potato. Not ON a potato, mind you. I had 35-40 fps in this on LOWEST settings. I had to download a setting script that made the game look like a bad PS2 game just in order for it to be on 60 FPS without constant stutters and jitters. And my computer ain't bad - I know that. I know that, from the specs and the game features - it is MORE THAN ENOUGH to run this game. But it isn't - because the devs do not know how to optimize for ****. It is a shameless act, especially for the year it was made for (and even to this point).  Alright, so I got past all that. Somehow. So how's the gameplay? It is exactly the same as the free mod! Alright, ALMOST the same. But the gameplay is near identical. Except for there being a couple of bugs in the combat system that a lot of people exploit. The mod has no such problems. So, if I can't enjoy the better graphics (since it runs like crap) and the gameplay is flawed - then why would pick this game instead of the free mod they've released long ago? That mod runs great and has absolutely no problems. The combat is the same. The mod, made many many years ago, is better than this 'full game'. What a joke.  In conclusion: uninstalled it and went back to Age of Chivalry (still has players btw, for a reason). I say don't bother. A lot of potential - but left for dead by the devs. Shame on you devs. For leaving the game unfixed and unoptimized. What a disappointment.",-1,0,0

As a non Total War series expert as this is the first Total War game i have played since Total War Medievel 2 i can asure you that this game is everything you would wise for in a game. Amazing textures even when zooming in and out of the map and closer into the battles of the game look amazing. The game is great for everyone new or experienced because of how you can set the difficulty of the campaign and this can be from easy to really difficult.  Everysingle Warhammer fan will find this game interesting and fun to play even if they are not a Total War fan because of the types of units for the different fractions as they all have unique units which all play and operate very differently.   I have also read many reviews on steam about this game before writing my own and honestly i am very shocked to have seen so many people click the thumbs down on the reccomendation option of there reviews due to small and silly things that are causing there gaming experience to not be as enjoyable as the others. alot of the people who gave the game a bad rating/ review are mainly explaining how the game is having technical difficulties and lets be open here, nobody likes technical difficulties espcially not on a game you have pre-purchased and want to play on the release date however things do go wrong and developers do miss things out and this happenes with most games however before giving the game a bad review due to your computer system doesnt meet the requirements or a genuie issue let the support teams help you first!

265930,Goat Simulator,"The thing about goat simulator is that its one of those games that is fun for a little bit and then you never play it again, you find the secrets and thats about it. It isn't really a game its just a simple sandbox that rather than having unlimited fun, it just kind of expires and you're left with nothing. I'd give cheers to the devs for getting new content out there, but the score system isn't enough to make it a game. No one bought goat simulator because they wanted to play it and get a high score, they bought it because they have nothing better to do and on account that the whole game is just a meme. Rather than making the whole game a joke being told over and over again, the developers should try to take an approach similar to Octodad, where the game had a STORY and there was a point of you being there, unlike Goat Simulator which doesn't really have an engaging goal or any story at all. Goat simulator's concept is alright, and it could work for sure, but the execution of it makes it bland and gives it a finite amount of entertainment. If the game was given a factor that made it feel a bit more like a game rather than just a limited sandbox then I might've given the game a positive rating. I realize I'm going to get hate for this practical look at this game based on my experience, and because when people read reviews they want everyone to have the exact same opinion. In conclusion, I rate Goat Simulator a 3/10, I think it just really needs a better pull factor than the score system and the 'memes'.",-1,1,0

It's scary, it makes you jump and freak out in the anticipation of jumping. It has some sort of charm to it and it's characters that is rare these days.  It's original, it's freaky, it's cheap, it's challenging, and as I mentioned before (the most important part) fun.  It's just as fun to introduce someone to the game and watch them play it in the dark as it is to play it yourself.  When I try to think of a list of people who would not like this game, I realize they're all kinda lame and not very exciting people, so if you're a fun person who's down to try cool stuff, give this game a go.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Garbage failed Mount and Blade clone. Anyone supporting this piece of s'hit needs to kill themselves.    Plays like a poor man's version of Mount &amp; Blade. M&amp;B's multiplayer does everything this game does but much better (including having 200 people in a server whilst this allows for a max of 32), except for the limb removal. The poor optimization and insanely bad netcode are also big issues (because of Unreal Engine 3). The biggest fault that I find however is that it doesn't feel like a team-game despite being presented as one. Fighting alongside allies is usually a detriment due to the friendly fire. None of the mechanics of the game encourage players to fight in cohesion or even really work as a team. Everything about the gameplay feels disjointed, like playing a mod of an FPS that never intended to have melee combat in the first place (that may well be how this game started). Also found it funny when I went to customize my knight and noticed 80% of the options are paid DLC as if this were some f2p game; now that's kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I got into this game because I played Warhammer Fantasy for years. I know nothing about the previous Total War games.  I'll recommend it because it's fun and keeps you busy. The Lore is well-represented and the battles are a lot of fun. I've mostly played the campaign, myself, and it has it's ups and downs. The AI will screw you over at every chance it gets, cheesing you out on even the lowest difficulty settings, careful planning and a lot of luck is needed if you want to get a good start.   Near the 40+ turn marker, I find it gets kind of weird, having to defend and recapture settlements over and over again (unless you're playing as Chaos or Beastmen of course) because it's virtually impossible to sustain 20 armies to defend each settlement. This hampers your conquest a ton and gets very repetitive. Especially as someone who favors the Greenskins, the campaign is fun... but seems unnecessarily tedious at some points.  The DLC policy for this game is completely rediculous. Nevertheless, the content it delivers is great. I know the whole 'don't feed the machine, duuuude' crowd will not be pleased but if you're willing to spend the extra cash, it's sort of worth it.  Overall; Good game. Great battles.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: Warhammer is one of the best looking Total War games I’ve played. The game runs better than Total War: Attilla does on my moderately powerful gaming PC based on the same settings (high) and averages a fairly smooth forty frames per second with no noticeable drops. The chunky Warhammer characters (reminiscent in style to Dawn of War) suit the Total War graphical style better than I expected them to, and as a result the license feels completely at home in the Total War shell.  In summary, Total War: Warhammer is almost everything I hoped it would be. It is perhaps the best use of the Warhammer license that I’ve ever seen, easily rivalling the Dawn of War series (which is thankfully different enough that I don’t need to decide which is better or worse) and perhaps delivering a game that is dangerously capable of pleasing both Total War and Warhammer fans alike, because of how well it handles the strengths and weaknesses of each. Sure, it’s no longer a case of rewriting world history, and true, trolls can actually be killed in Total War: Warhammer, but the balance of benefits comes together to create a great looking, interesting and often challenge take on large-scale, real-time strategy.",1,0,1

363970,Clicker Heroes,"This game has been changing a lot rather quickly. First, you had the Dread Knight, which was the point where lots of players just gave up and stopped trying, like I did. Back then, you had to ascend (Pretty much like prestige, wiping your progress just to get a tiny bonus that keeps stacking the more you keep doing it) over and over again a few times before you were able to get past zone 140 or so, because the price of the Dread Knight was astronomically insane. Lots of us, who hate doing the equivalent of rolling heavy rocks up a hill just to watch them roll down again, just stopped playing here.  After that, they decided to add mercenaries, and my god, this change was amazing. Now, you didn't had to ascend anymore, you could simply send your mercenaries to farm Hero Souls and money, and getting through the zones was pretty much a breeze now. You could also farm those random fish drops in hopes of getting rubies, and you could also send your mercenaries for rubies, too. So, you could skip ascending altogether, just gather enough rubies for a quick ascension, and there you go! I got through zone 200-1800 that way, and it seems like the game was getting a bit too easy, but still, you could finally feel some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing progress.  Then, update 1.0 came. They nerfed lots of ancients, for example, it was quite easy to get Chronos stupidly OP, giving you like an extra 300 seconds for your boss timer if you were an idler like me. They nerfed it so it only gives you around 16 extra seconds or so. But hey! You can level Chronos up now! It's just going to cost you 5 quadrillion souls! For a whooping .22 seconds. So, idling now like in the old days was out of the question. But hey, you could still gather rubies to get another quick ascension, right? Well, yes, but now, there's super ancients basically, that look like Lovecraftian old ones. What's the catch? You HAVE to trASScend to get these, which means you have to wipe your progress. Just ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to wipe your progress if you wanna get far now. And nope, there's nothing you can do to avoid said wipe. So, unless you've got an awful lot of time to spend in this game, getting far is now pretty much a pain in the ♥♥♥. Going from zone 1950 or so all the way back to zone 1 makes me feel like killing myself. And I didn't even got that far compared to other players out there.   This is where I call quits, they just nerfed everything that exists to give you an excuse to grind harder.

Either way there's no way to predict when it'll happen. And it doesn't happen rarely it happens somewhat often. When it does happen I need to spend another 3 mins trying to load the game to work. And sometimes you won't even know if the game crashes or not unless you manually go back to your desktop and find the crash window. On top of the crashes there's also a ton of hacks in the game. Some people have unlimited stamina and insane run speed. And they don't seem interested in fixing the hacks or banning accounts that have them. Either way it kills the enjoyment for everyone else that's trying to enjoy the game.   Even with all the bugs and hacks there's also the problem of rank stacking as well. It's when a group of high level players will stack on a team, and these are the people that complain about low ranked servers being in existence. So beginners playing against them will have no chance to learn in a heavily steep learning curve of a game.  If they fixed at least some of the issues i mentioned the game would be immensely better.",-1,0,0

With the new update it breaks the game on computers that have played the game before Wood elves with no problem. It broke mine to the point where I decided to do a full reinstall on my PC only to now have the game not download at all. I've attempted to contact CA to no avail.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I think it is very easy with the Steam review system to recieve an incomplete understanding of how good a game is or isn't. With just a thumbs up or down it is hard for anyone to tell you much about a game. So I would like to break this game down as much as possible to give you are really good source for information.  Firstly lets address the negative reviews that state 'the game is great, I had a lot of fun but **** DLC'. These reviews are not reviewing the game. Ignore them immediatly, there are problems with this game but DLC is an option the problem would only be if the game did not have enough content to begin with.  So lets look at that, what do you get in the base game. The base game gives you 4 races, Empire, Vampire Counts, Dwarfs and Greenskins. The map that you are playing on is set in the Old World of the Warhammer universe. By default all races have 2 legendary lords however through the free updates some have gotten more. Each campaign can take anywhere from 40 to 70 hours to complete. If you consider 1 dollar an hour a pretty good investment this game oozes good value. However if it is **** that would not matter.  Alright so gameplay, this section has to be split into two sections campaign and battle. Starting with campaign this side of the map is a perfect example of 10 steps forward 2 steps back.   Campaign Pros: All cam,paigns FEEL really different Diplomacy is easy to use and understand Stances are all useful and feel intuitive Visuals are beautiful Cities changing to match faction is an amazing addition Economy is limited forcing players to actually make desicions when building armies  Campaign Cons: Regional Occupation (The concept that only certain races can occupy certain cities, terrible idea) Movement in your land is same speed as enemy causing annoying chases through your land Though cities due change when upgraded it is very hard to see the difference unlike Attila or Rome 2  Onto battles, the battles stay mainly the same from previous games with the addition of crazy new units to spice it up. The Ai is also much improved. You can tell a ton of work went into making these great. However the games keep pushing towards smaller maps and faster battles which may have gone a little to far in this one.  Battle Pros: AI (it can actually put up a good fight) Diversity Magic Visuals Custimizable UI (Bound to space bar) Nice additions to control make it easy to move army Impacts are greatly improved  Battle Cons: No blood (Maybe I'm just messed up) Lack of kill animations (understand the point of removing the match combat of older games however a system like Dawn of War where when they go to kill an enemy it plays a combat animation would have been nice) Maps are very small Battles are very short (5 minutes - 8 minutes)  Lastly we need to discuss seiges and the lack of battle diversity in terms of types. Total War Warhammer features two battle types, seige and land battles, no minor settlement battles, no fort battles and no naval battles (not so salty about the last)  Seige Pros: The first few feel epic Art is beautiful  Seige Cons: Single or double wall leaves zero strategy Entire battle is spent watching your troops slowly try to break past theirs Infinite tower range makes artillery useless Only feels like there are 5 different maps Different factions have the same settlements with different art Dwarfs are the most dissapointing as if you want their trailer it shows multi tiered setlements  In conclussion, Total War Warhammer improves on much and gives you a ton of value for the money you are spending, even without mods or DLC. Some of the issues I have mentioned can be fixed with mods. With the game all moded out like mine is the only issue I still see are that seige battles are dull and lack strategy. Other than that this game is amazing and if you love TW like I do this is a breath of fresh air into a very old franchise.",1,0,1

This is because i then downloaded it off its website because it wasnt working, it took 24hours to install and when i played the game its low graphics, frame rate draps shocked me. the matches hold loads of people for a very war like experience but large scale skirmishes often turn into a mushy mess of textures and low frame rate. furthermore when you choose a faction you don't get to change. EVER. and because of this battles are often unballenced because of the server not being able to ballence skill levels because of factions. The game may have a good feel of war but its gratest moments are when lots of people are on a server but this causes low frame rate to the point of not being able to play.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"When you first join Planetside 2 it seems just like any other shooter, but when you get away from the initial base and into a fight you can really see the amazing difference. Planetside 2 features thousands of players per map, and there are 3 maps per server that you can warp between (it also features a training are where you can test guns and other gear before you purchase them and lets you practice with no cooldown on vehicles or respawn timer as well as practicing in a friendly enviroment where your not getting shot at). And it does this with almost no lag i have only lagged a tiny bit, and iv played almost 100 hours, and they are working on getting rid of that tiny bit of lag that happens when the servers get super full. I absolutely love this game, its so amazing instead of being like all those other generic shooters you cant learn where everybody sits an waits, camping doesnt work so well. you have massive maps to fight on. you really have to stratigize and work with your teamates. there are three factions to pick from. You can do basicly anything you want, drive tanks, humvee's, atv's dropships, gunships whatever, the possibilities are endless. the classes are so easy to customize to your unique play style whatever that may be. Do you want to sit back and snipe, lay down heavy fire, heal your buddies? doesnt matter there is a class for you and if the fit isnt perfect, you can customize even further. Honestly i dont think this game will ever get old, and i really think that even as great as it is, its only going to get better. the realism is amazing. and as a plus if your parents are against M games, dont worry you can still play. I love how you cant just rush the enemy base you have to work together with other squads, your tanks, and of course your air support. No matter what you want to do, there is something here for you, and dont get discouraged if you die, this is war it happens.   My advice for new players is first find your class, then play with some other more experienced players. keep your head down till you get more experience and never give up.",1,0,1

A great, atmospheric and desolate world to explore, plenty of stories shown in the environment and in sidequests, exploring the concrete jungle of the downtown district is seldom tiring, and the main plot is pretty engorssing, too, even if the characters are a little forgettable (oddly enough, New Vegas is just the reverse).

This game is not fun without friends - seriously - everyone agrees you need teammates you know to enjoy learning the ropes. This game is a masterpiece. I cannot recommend this game - losing is so infuriating and crushing that you'll sit down to relax, play a game, then an hour has gone by and you are angrier than you ever could've imagined.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I really can't believe how bad this game is due to other reviews of it. Very tired of Ubisoft formula. SCORE 41/100.  I thought it just had to be cool. I was let down in nearly every way imaginable. Still shocked how subpar, derivative, repetitive, and poorly designed it was. After beating and selling Watch Dogs (PS4), and then getting this on Summer Sale and really not liking it at all, I came to the conclusion I will no longer buy the trinity of Ubisoft open world action games.   If you have played any Assassin's Creed or Watch Dogs, then you've played this. Towers to unlock, stupid collectibles, incredibly poor stealth, no actual cover.  TOWERS ARE SO FAR APART, horrible when you die. This is a perfect example of huge open world that is empty, lifeless, and annoying. So, so annoying.  Inventory is an atrocity, fills up in minutes, herbs don't stack. The driving is even worse than Watch Dogs, if that is possible. You get hurt from very small jumps, it's stupid.  In some ways I am glad I got it on summer sale because I won't ever get another Ubisoft game at full price. I *might* get them for 10 bucks or buy and resell of the PS4, but never ever full price.  And the graphics aren't that great, because Ubisoft is really bad at optimizing game engines. Tomb Raider and Hitman Absolution look much better.  To top it all off, UPLAY IS A NIGHTMARE. It's a terrible service that makes EA's Origin look fantastic in comparison, and that is saying a lot.",-1,0,0

You will only find new ids from the old players who will ķeep flaming,blaming,reporting and ruining the whole match. If you buy a high lv id you will find, it's not only you who bought the id. It'll be just the same.  The game matchmaking management is a chaos. The system intentionally mix up each team from low to high lv. So the teamwork will be a chaos. Imbalance players' skills, pro has to cooperate with newbies.  Later if you still can love this game, you will not be able to find anyone to play with in this game. There's no guild, or anything that can make you find friends, you'll only find enemies the more you play.  And the greatest thing is the report player in game feature. Any players can be banned and go to low priority automatically by any other players. So if you are the best in your team who make the enemy team lose, prepare yourself to be reported by at least 5 players. Instead of getting good prize or bonus coz of doing great with all your power in the game, You will get punished and go to low prior.  When you make prediction to get bonus when win, the game will announce it to all players. Then the whole players in your team will ruin the match, so you lose your prediction. That's why dota2 make an announcement when you predict.  For me to keep playing this game, is just impossible. Go try it, i've warned you. The stress and despair is waiting for you.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Oh the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, where to begin. A low ping is actually a DISADVANTAGE because of client side hit detection with no latency limit. Your enemy will put 10 bullets into you and it will show up as a single hit on your machine, giving you no chance to react. Oh, but it'll require you to fire for a solid second to kill them back.  Rockets actually move SLOWER THAN VEHICLES! This is even more dumb once you find out it takes literally 5 seconds to reload, and your entire pool of 5 rockets will generally only serve to annoy weaker vehicles. And if you actually do manage to scuff the paint on your target? They'll just back up and repair it in a few seconds anyway.  They gave a class invisibility and did no better a job of balancing such a broken mechanic than every multiplayer game that's attempted it before.  There are pistols and submachine guns that are stronger than machine guns. 1 hit kill weapons in a high TTK game.  The game includes auto-run not because it's convenient, but because it's necessary. In other words, prepare to spend a lot of time running between battles.  I have never been in a game where the terrain was so awful to navigate. So many random impassible ravines, mountains, rivers, etc. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you! Bases are also a pain to navigate due to random walls and obstacles placed with no apparent rhyme or reason. When every building is the same (not looks similar, literally is the same), it adds to the confusion about where exactly you are at any given point in time. Of course, that's if you can even find your way into the base in the first place. Many have walls for days with only a few entrances in seemingly random locations.  Bio-labs are an endless cluster♥♥♥♥ meatgrinder. Imagine BF3 metro with walking tanks and a much longer walk back for the attackers.  The developer also has a poor track record of dealing with hackers and exploiters. There are some still exploiting their hearts out 9+ months after video evidence first surfaced of their misdeeds.  This game is just rife with bad design and technical flaws that makes things vastly more infuriating than fun. Stay far, far away. An alternative you might try is Heroes &amp; Generals.

Everything frrom classes to vehicles, ground and air, are there for you to use.  The community is also amazing. Full of helpful people who wish to fight for whatever clan they chose to play for in the war, and the medics are never hesitant to help you out, nor are the engineers ever hesitant to hand you some ammo.

A few patches back the game run smoth tbh i tought the lag was gone i could easily run around the big fights and make a diffrence but now its laggier then ever,,  im using a GTX nvidia 760 it should crush this, but ive notice it eats RAM memory aswell even if you got 8 or 16gb worth of it.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"How to Accept Your Autism  Being autistic can be rough. People tell you that you're embarrassing, that you're rude or insensitive, or that you're a puzzle that needs to be completed in order to be whole. But that doesn't mean that they're right. This article will help you come to terms with your autism so you can focus on being the wonderful human being that you are.  Meet the autistic community. This can be done by contacting a friendly support group, or through a search online. Learn what autistic people have to say about themselves, their symptoms, and the way they interact with the world. Autistic people in general are very welcoming to newly-diagnosed or self-diagnosed people. Autistic people can offer advice and tips to those in need (and often do so, especially online) The general positivity of the autism community can help you feel better when you are feeling sad or have low self-esteem.  Read about the strengths that come along with autism. Autism is a complex neurological condition that comes with several blessings along with its impairments: Deeply passionate interests. These can lead to tremendous expertise, and a very successful career.[1] Helpfulness. Autistic people in general have a high sense of social responsibility, or the desire to solve problems and help others.[2] Precision. Autism is often noted to lead to focusing on small parts, rather than the big picture. This can lead to remarkable detail-oriented work, where a neurotypical might be unable to focus so clearly on individual aspects of something.[3] Visual intelligence. Autistic people have tested higher on visual and nonverbal intelligence tests.[4] Sincerity. Autistic people tend to mean what they say, and act as a 'voice of reason' without becoming mired in social complexities.[5] Your honesty and genuine spirit can feel refreshing to others. A unique perspective. Autistic people can learn in unusual ways.[6] This provides insights that neurotypicals may never realize, and can become a great asset in collaboration.  Find therapies and treatments that work for you. These will help you work on your weaknesses so that you feel more comfortable and happy. You can also learn coping mechanisms, alternative methods of doing difficult tasks, and how to capitalize on your strengths. Options include sensory integration therapy, seeing an autism expert (for coping strategies), occupational therapy, special diets in case you are allergic or sensitive to something, behavior therapy, and seeing a psychologist for emotional issues. Always check with a doctor before altering your diet or attempting an alternative treatment. Be careful about behavior therapies. Some therapies are based on compliance and may hurt more than helping.[7] If your therapist's goal is to make you more normal (rather than more comfortable or more competent), or if you feel upset and anxious about seeing them, then find a better therapist.  Make autistic friends. Along with the usual benefits of friendship, you can share coping strategies, discuss autism together, and be yourselves without any fear of repercussions.  Read about successful autistic people. Plenty of famous people have been diagnosed or thought to be autistic. Historically, Einstein,[8] Thomas Jefferson, Emily Dickinson,[9] Mozart,[10] and more people were thought to be autistic.[11] Famous autistic people today include Tim Burton,[12] Susan Boyle,[13] Adam Young (from Owl City),[14] Jerry Seinfeld,[15] and more.[16]  Focus on your skills and character strengths. This will help you spend less energy mourning your disability, and more energy on doing positive things and enjoying your life. Spend time on your hobbies and things that you're good at. Enjoy the feeling of competence and expertise. Make a list of your positive traits. Consider both personality traits and skills. Place the list somewhere where it'll be easy to see when you're feeling sad about yourself. Help other people. Prepare food for the hungry, raise awareness for important causes, or volunteer for online projects like wikiHow. Effecting a positive change in the world will distract you, help others, and make you feel happier about yourself.  Avoid people and organizations that dehumanize you. You are not broken or lesser. People like you do not deserve to be abused, coerced, silenced, or eugenically aborted. It is okay to cut toxic people out of your life. You don't need their negativity, and you're much better off without them. You are not required to argue that your existence is worthwhile, and it's okay to decide not to waste your time and energy on them. If you're stuck with these people, you have two main choices: to educate them, or to avoid them. Educating them can be done by showing them an article, and making an appeal to their desire to be a good person. If you try this and fail, or if you know that they won't respond to reason, it's better to avoid spending time with them, and avoid autism-related conversations. You don't deserve to listen to toxic ideas about your existence.  Practice self-care. Being disabled can be difficult, and it's important to treat yourself well. Cut out energy drains from your life so you can focus on what matters most to you. Pushing yourself to meet neurotypical standards will only take a toll on your health. It is okay to ask for academic accommodations, take extra breaks, or quit doing things that are too stressful to achieve. Pay extra attention to general health advice: sleep for at least 8 hours, eat fruits and vegetables, limit junk food, minimize stress, and exercise regularly (taking walks counts). Self-care is extra important for you, to mitigate stress and help with meltdowns. If you have trouble with self-care, it's okay to ask for help. Assisted living, a group home, or living with your parents might be better for you. Talk with a doctor, social worker, or therapist if you're struggling. There's no shame in meeting your needs, and it'll free up time for things you love.  Stop apologizing for being autistic. You have the right to ask for accommodations, stim in public, and do what you need to do in order to function. Toning down your behavior is your choice—not something to be pushed or coerced out of you. You are not required to act more neurotypical just because everyone else is used to it.  Get involved with positive autism-related organizations. They will help you understand yourself better and make a positive contribution to the world. Many autism self-advocacy groups have a large online presence. You do not need to physically go somewhere in order to get involved.  Recognize that autism is just a thing of your imagination. People can not love you and your autism. You are a lesser person for it.",-1,1,0

570,Dota 2,"7.00 is here, and its a blast. For sure I cannot say 100% if in the end the gameplay will be better or worse, and that because unlike some creatures of habit that feel their world come crushing down on them before even trying to learn the new changes, I will put more time into it to make a better judegement. For that reason alone no-one should take any of the hating seriously. Some people actually played 1 match in the new patch then quit. Wha? How can you know if it is better or worse like that?  All I can say is what I do like about it so far.  I like the direction of talents. They do not change a hero drastically like I feared, and got rid of the useless attributes.  UI is great, minimal and out of your face giving better vision which is always important in a competitive game and something that alays bugged me.  New map layout needs more playtime to be get a proper review from me, but so far I was able to jump into it and learn it quite fast. Shop locations are now FINALY balanced without the dire having to go to the moon for it (yeah, those few extra steps count guys), Roshan is no longer cheeply contested with dire jungle next to him and a river now surrounds him, and more jungles are added to up the importance of jngling.  The biggest changes are the shrines and the new bounty locations. This all is a step closer to PROPER jungling which was sorely lacking in this game. All it was thus far was go from camp to camp and rinse and repeat. Added bounty has also made jungling a more viable strategy, very much needed, and jungle control has now also become more important thus map control.  To compensate for some of these changes shrines add replenish locations closer to the lanes, allowing for better laning, and also a defensive strategy when need be against either ganks or bounty hunters in your jungle (no pun intended, lol).  Shrines also create for a better defence around the ancient.  Small additions like 3 slot bag and courier options are also much appreceated (you can now see who had called it before you and send it back, or alter the route of the courier, then continue its path to said player).  In general the patch is great, and it did not simplify the game neither LoL-ish it. It added much needed depth and gameplay in areas that were trully lacking. Jungling. Jungling in this game was really behind compared to other moba titles in the compatition.  And for all those saying why would they make it like LoL. They didn't, they are adding improvements most moba games already have. You don't evolve wih the genre you die out, simple, and there were elements in Dota2 that were lacking.  Given time, I can bet most of the haters will love the new patch. Except for the pretentious ones that are stuck in the notion that this is becoming like LoL and feel this is a bad thing.  Neither is true. Dota 2 is still dota 2. Adding elements increases depth, nothing was taken away, and the pace of the game was greatly improved. The layers to new strategy have now become a lot more, and people are simply frantically rushing about trying to learn it hence not happy about old tricks not working.  That is called a habit. Competitve games can do without that tyvm.  Definately recommend this title, still to this day.",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,  I don't get why this game is iconic. The mechanics are very very off tier. I don't get valve and why they have to push ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dota 2 and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cs:go. The community's are so cancerous and annoying. Traditional valve players want tf2 updates that actually fix the damn weapons. Coming from a kid that played ever half life and have owned tf2 since 2007 (on console). Valve needs to forget about these disgusting games. They're not even fun because of the communities and the really annoying players. Battles never change its the same gameplay every single game nothing changes. This game just needs to disappear away from the space time continuum. I regret even putting minutes into this and I feel I'm on a lonely lonely ship with no one on it.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"If you're looking for a medieval game with competetive multiplayer, realistic mechanics, beautiful graphics, balanced classes including archer and knight... then you better look somewhere else. If you're thinking that this game has realistic combat you obviously didn't play it. Chivalry Medieval Warfare is a game that makes you wanna smash your PC with a 2-handed hammer (with nice skin for 5 $) and then throw it out of the window.   I bought this game on sale and i thought I'd get realistic combat. What I actually got was a bunch of knights making crazy-♥♥♥ tricks with swords, archers with daggers faster than light ( spam2win), and dudes killing you with their bare fists. No joking. In this game a knight with full-set plate armor can be fisted (you could expect this joke) to death. Also if you're thinking that archer can't parry/block a massive 2-handed warhammer that in reality could smash through a brick wall, your computer and your first born son you're right. It can't. In reality. In this game it's actually possible.  But it doesn't matter that this game is awful. It's not bad and can be very enjoyable if you can hold on your nerves. If it's not the realism you're looking for you'll probably like it. I, unfortunately, bought this game hoping I'd get realism. And although I enjoyed playing it I can't really recommend it.   This game had a huge potential, but unfortunately for me (and some others) this game was a disappointment. Pretty much like me for my parents, I should be learning but instead I'm writing about a game I don't even like. Gotta end this here.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I've played my fair share of this game as you can see how many hours are played. This game used to be to good untill 2012 maybe early 2013 where they made a big patch which just changed the game and alot of its aspects which turned to crap. Big unbalance between Factions, guns and classes have gotten worse. Bugs and exploits are more common as time and new patched go by as well. They keep adding silly things to vehicles and odd guns which happens to be recolors or retextures of guns that are already in the game but for their in-game cash shop instead of balancing fixing bugs in the game. I might be burnt out of this game but I know for a fact that the game isn't what it used to be around 2-3 years ago. Dev's seem not to care (from what I see) about the game. Latency and hit Reg aren't the best at times and bugs/exploits tend to take months to fixup when all it takes is a hotfix. Thanks for reading my essay ehehehehehh.

570,Dota 2,Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). It is a direct sequel to the popular Warcraft 3 Modification. This game has been picked up by Valve corporations and is being worked on by none other than one of the original creators of the Warcraft 3 Modification. After its official launch on the 9th July 2013 it has been a massive hit in the MOBA genre. With it being the number one game on the free to play list on steam and arguably being on par with the largest contender on the MOBA market - League Of Legends.   The game corporates a large roster of playable heroes which are instantly available with gameplay which can offer ten times the amount of strategy and depth compared to any other game on the MOBA market. This combined with players who are working on the game for other players and the fact that the game is trademarked by steam. Dota 2 also has a large competitive scene including the annual “The International Tournament” held by steam.  I totally recommend Dota 2 to anyone with a computer. The ability to play casually or professionally with your friends really is awesome! xD 94/100 -Dom ,1,1,1

The Chivalry community is tiny and elitist and hostile towards new players and foreign points of view. The fight mechanics are exploitable the community overly sensitive and competitive. With guys just wanting to have fun its great, with the try hard fan boy wannabe pro gamer crowd that is the majority of commited players in the servers outside the starting ranks its the opposite. The forums even have moderators slinging nasty little comments at new players that this isn't the game for them, breaking their arms patting themselves on the back for their amazing skills. Telling new players learning the exploits is like growing up, missing the irony of people playing a video game and taking that seriously talking about growing up.   Remeber every fan boy of this game who will tell us we need to learn and play their gamer their way. Games are supposed to be fun, not work, I and most gamers are not interested in treating this game or any other with that level of commitment nor should we.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Bethesda Game Studios knows how to make a time-consuming game. Fallout 3 is one of the few games that I can play for 5 hours and feel like I've only played for a half hour. The main story line is somewhat linear compared to other aspects of the game, but I'm not the type of person that's bothered by that. There are countless side quests that don't feel like pointless tasks as side quests do in many games that I've experienced.   The only real complaint that I have, if any, is that the use of V.A.T.S. is a MUST in order to survive the wasteland well. The game doesn't FORCE you to use the system, however. If you can afford to spend the extra ammo, there's nothing stopping you from running into a horde of super mutants, guns ablazin'.  A word of caution to those running Windows 7: MAKE SURE YOU SAVE PERIODICALLY WHEN ROAMING THE VAST LANDSCAPE. Fallout 3 has a wonderful autosave feature, but even that might not save you if the game crashes on you. There are several articles for Win7 fixes for Fallout 3, but even those don't solve 100% of problems.  Other than the lack of Windows 7 optimization, this game is incredible. 10/10  (Get hyped for Fallout 4!)",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"TL;DR: Have you ever worked on something where no matter what you did, it would reset, and you spent days doing the exact same step over and over praying that it'd make progress but it never seemed to? PS2 is like that except there's no hope of moving forward.   I've been trying to play PlanetSide 2 for a long time, but now I've finally got my chance, since my computer is now decent. I cannot fault the action or character progression. Both are amazing.  Character progressions is the standard unlock/upgrade with mods system, with boosts only being enough that you'd win a one on one fight, and slow enough that it provides interest in continuing to play.   One on one fights sound like a lot? I can see that, in pretty much any other FPS. In this game, if you're getting into 1 on 1 fights, you're playing so wrong. The game gives you a maximum snipe range of 1,000 meters (but I've only been able to get reasonable kills at 500 meters with the assault rifles). The long range combat is incredible.  That's not to say one on one fights are unsupported. There's a class designed for it, Light Assault, which has a jetpack to allow you to sneak ontop of your targets.  This game has mixed arms combat. As in, the tanks, aircraft, and infantry all have to fight the same battle on the same map, and you can destroy tanks as infantry, or aircraft as a tank, and ect. This creates an epic feeling when you shoot a rocketeer with a rifle and kill them before they can take out a friendly tank.  So, why don't I recommend this game? Staff abuse? Rude community? Just angry that I'm no good at it?  No. I don't recommend this game... Because there is no win or lose state.  Seeing as there is only 4 maps in the game, that are all going at once, they don't want players to take over a map and lock their enemy out of that map, as that might make their enemy have a less fun experience. I can agree and see that. it'd probably be very common for a faction to get wiped off all maps and thereby prevent their spawning.   If the game had several maps, it'd be near impossible for a faction to get wiped off of all of them, and even then, they could swap to another map.    They don't want to do this. Instead, the way the game works is only 2 of the 4 continents in the game can be controlled at once. If another gets taken, it'll unlock one of the previous maps.  So the entire game is just a constant struggle where no one will ever be ahead or behind.   I wouldn't be too upset about this except every thread online I can find about it has people DEFENDING this choice as if it's a good idea!!   It's not a good idea. It's putting a bandaid over a missing arm.  That said, the gameplay is fun. If you're 12 years old and like brainlessly shooting people for no reason, it's a good alternative to school shootings.  3/10",-1,0,0

First off for this game, if you want a worthwhile tutorial, then you won't get one. This game is the hardest game to pick up that I've ever seen because you feel so insignificant and under powered compared to everyone else. This is horrible for keeping players. If you pick this game up I reccomend going on Youtube and watching a channel called Wrel. He is very good for new player tutorials and helped me become the (meh) player I am today. The game itself is absolutely beautiful at night and in big battles. The infantry gameplay is fun with 6 main classes. Light Assaults, they have jetpacks and close quarter carbines, Infiltrators, the snipers and stealthy class of the game, Heavy Assault, with rocket launchers and an overshield to absorb damage, Medics, they can revive people, Engineers, they give ammo and can repair Max's and place turrets, and finally MAX units. They are walking tanks of death that are extremely hard to take down but are slow and can easily be killed by C4. These classes make each battle unique and can actually make for some really interesting strategy's. The vehicles are nice and have a depth of custimization, like the infantry.

This both allows players to fortify location and creates an epic vehicle meta. To destory a well fortified player-made base massive groups of armor and infantry come together to make a truely EPIC spectical and shows what Planetside has to offer.  The UI has been though several revisions and now allows players to pick from a drop down menu in the settings which they prefer.  Planetside 2 has so much to offer to players that there really should be something everyone can find and enjoy. If you enjoy tank warfare then pull tanks, if you like building bases pull the new ANT and mine resources, if you like dogfights and air to ground combat pull a ESF, if you like infantry there are several classes to pick from that have unique playstyles and roles. There are support classes for infantry like medic and engineer, support classes for ground vehicles like ammo and repair sundys, there are even support roles in the air like the massive galaxy transport that can be modified to act as a air ammo resupply.  ____________________________________  Pros:  -Free 2 Play -Combined Arms -Player Made Bases -UI options -Grand Scale -No Matchmaking -3 Factions with different weapons can allow for a re-freshed experiance by trying another faction.  Cons:  -CPU intensive -Poor Tutorial (Youtube tutorials are recommended) -Can be hard to know where to go when playing alone -All players new and experianced on same field (experianced players know alot more about the map and how to deal with different situations)  ____________________________________  In the end Planetside is coming up on its 4 year anniversary and is still here.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is good.  What it lacks in occasional polish and poor storyline (and _abysmal_ voice acting. Those accents *can't* be real...) It more than makes up for in charm.  Well, not the voice acting, someone should go to jail for that.  It's fun, visceral (often gruesomely so), and pretty even money, since the blocking mechanics are a bit twitchy and all the weapons hit with so much heft, even classically poor players of FPS-type games like this will find their K/D ratio pleasantly high (Mine was better than one for a while, which is rare for me).   It's not without bugs, but if you can get past the mislabelled key tooltips and occasional glitchy display, it's really fun. Definitely a game a group of people to cause a lot of trouble playing whilst drunk on a friday night. Any level of coordination would be devestating, fortunately, coordination never happens in pugs, so otherwise it's just gory medieval fun.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is a first-person fighting game (FFG?) built around close-range melee combat, with a smattering of archery. It never loses sight of the fact that, fancy moves or no, getting personal is a messy business. Heads, legs and arms fly by the dozen in every match, a feature made approximately ten billion times better by the fact that you can further de-limb opponents as they stare in shock at the first mortal blow. There is nothing quite like hacking someone's arm off, then executing a swift and true beheading as they stare open-mouthed at the stump.The gratuitous brutality of knightly melee combat teeters between comedic and cathartic in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare's gory encounters. Well-placed killing blows send limbs and heads flying, accompanied by fountains of blood spewing from drippy stumps that call to mind the iconic Black Knight duel in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's hilarious at times and excessively gruesome. Gutting foes has a lot more weight to it here than in other recent entries in the Medieval combat genre like War of the Roses or Mount and Blade: Warband. That alone doesn't make Chivalry the best in its class, but it does incite a certain bloodlust that'll keep you charging into the chaos.",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"What can I say about Far Cry 3? The game is pretty. That is the only good thing I have to say about this game.  The following review may contain spoilers!!! You've been warned!!! You start Far cry 3 and the first thing you notice is how great everything looks and you think to yourself 'This is gonna be great'. Since this is a game that lets you free roam you do the first storyline mission, maybe two and then you just go explore. The problem with exploring is there really isn't anything to explore. You have to liberate the radio tower in an area to unlock the map and then you get 2-3 camps to liberate to remove enemy soldiers from the area. The only other thing to do is find all the collectible crap that might unlock signature weapons but mostly is just there to keep the OCD people playing until they complete 100%. Everything that was fun or interesting about the game was over by the time I finished the first island. The second island in the game was not fun at all and contains pretty much every crappy gimmick that has been put into video games in the past decade. Seriously timed button presses, mini games, and poorly made rail shooters. I only completed the storyline missions on the second island just so I could finish the game. It wasn't fun, interesting, or engaging. It seems like they knew their game was bad so they decided to make you have to jump through hoops to unlock literally everything in the game. You have to unlock the map, the weapons, extra weapon slots, extra ammo slots, all the skills, literally everything. Nothing in this game happens without you performing some kind of grind. This isn’t fun, what happened to the days when games were fun?   ",-1,0,0

If you are looking for such game - this one is not your choice. Chivalry is still full of bugs and glitches that many players use. This game is not a 'game skill' contest, it's 'glitch masters' contest. The one that knows most of game mechaincs bugs wins. Glitched dragging, ground sniffering, abnormal character moves etc. is what give you advantage over enemies, not your game skills. ag You do not have to learn the game by playing, just go learn all this stuff that rakes game mechanics, it's all on youtube. And those who use it consider it as a 'skill' and devs do nothing about that. So if you like to enter 'who's more effective bug user' contest that's your game.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Good fun, can be slightly addictive. Absolutely huge and plenty of options for just mucking about. You will die a lot but so does everyone else. The videos pretty much show it all. Aircraft, vehicles, huge battles. LOTS of explosions and the chance to make it not a fair fight all the time, providing you're sneaky enough. It can be a bit buggy, and sometimes the the servers will lag to the point where it's just unplayable but they're usually back to normal in an hour but tbh that sort of stuff should be taken as a given considering i don't know another game like this that takes place on this sort of scale.  Edit: i have since found that the lagging (actually desyncng) is fixed if i disconnect my laptop (only my laptop other laptops work fine alongside with it) from the wifi. Also after a planned patch update it might be worth not playing for a day or two, because the patches always mess up the logging in and usually break something (like sticking at 96/98% on the loading screen). For a free game it's a great FPS, I can get a bit grindy but the stock weapons are fine for new players (tend to be midranged weapons) and if you feel you're grinding you're probably not playing the game right as the point of games is to have fun, not to feel like work. Also the lack of tutorial (or at least the basicness of it) is rather poor, so for the first few hour's you'll be dying a lot more than you will once you've found your feet but after about 5 or so hour's you'll get used to it. If you want a complete mincer of a fight that's safeish from vehicles go to a biolab fight. You'll still die a lot but you'll get some kills and remember to try stuff in the VR (it's an option at the bottom of the continent change interface). Find a good outfit and fight with them.",1,0,1
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Having played 16 hours now, I will review. Chivalry is a pretty cool game but it has its ups and downs. Having unlocked nearly all of the weapons in 16 hrs of game play I am pretty much bored and done with it for now. So here are some pros/cons/and suggestions for future games of this type.  Pros: - The concept is amazing.  -The team objective modes are the best part of this game and the only reason I keep playing. It is super fun and brilliant. Could be expanded upon more though. - The way the weapon system works and unlocking of weapons is smart and a good way to keep people playing and motivated to get better at the game.  -War cry button = awesome -team damage counter and ability to kick out people that keep team killing is a good feature - good diversity of class/weapon types   Cons: -No female characters.  -Limited costume options. -maps and characters limited to medieval Europe.  - armor difference between vanguard and the knight isn't significantly noticeable.  - Some melee weapon ranges are off. Have received damage from weapons that havent actual come in contact with my character.  -lastly, and simply from the perspective of someone who makes historical recreations of medieval plate armor in steel... some of the costumes are not really very historically accurate. But you can see where some, even small degree, of effort was applied here and that is commendable.   Suggestions: - Add more than just medieval Europe. This creates more diversity of character/weapon types and maps. Middle eastern fighters, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. All of these areas where in some degree of contact at the time and would add a great deal of diversity to game play.  - My last suggestion would be to strive for more historical accuracy, especially in a game that seems to be trying to avoid being a fantasy game. The more realistic you can make such a thing the more truly amazing it will be. The only counter suggestion to this is adding female characters. There are a large number of female gamers and they need to be included. I have tried to get a few of my female gamer friends to play with me and they have refused because there is not character to represent them in the game. All and all, awesome work! Make another one :) ",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"DotA is the bizzare lovechild of several concepts. It sinks its psychological hooks so deep into you so insidiously that you don't even notice, in an example of conditioning that makes World of Warcraft look like childrens television. You are connected to a slot machine that costs no money to play, only time - the only catch being that each attempt takes 30 minutes to an hour and only after 10 or so minutes do you begin to have an idea of just how the experience will end. This is where the hell of DotA begins. Every damn time I press that  Play Game  button I think to myself,  Oh, i'll have a nice, good fun game that will take me at most, 30 minutes .   Each time, I couldn't be more wrong   Playing DotA is the reminiscient of being thrown into a group discussion at school. Except the people in your group are sociopathic, narcissistic monsters who will attack you at the first sign of weakness. I am fairly certain that a large portion of the players in DotA are actually hired by scientists who are trying to see if it is possible to create sustainable energy through human misery and anger. DotA players seem to be able to perform mental acrobatics that chinese professional gymnasts dream of each night. They simulatiously except your team to perform feats of teamwork that not even trained Russian professionals can pull off, while playing slightly better then a catatonic chicken. These people are horrible, horrible people, second only to /b/ trolls and parking inspectors.  And when you finally do meet good people and finally do have good games, these moments seem to somehow become engraved in your brain as how your percive DotA. The fantastic, jaw dropping moments that seem to rise you above the dregs of humanity seem to occur as frequently as saints coming down into the mortal world. Valve somehow has engineered these miracles to occur (Which I think might be proof of the divine), only to corrupt it into some sort of heroin-like substance that is delivered through spending a copius amount of time sitting in front of a monitor. The highs in DotA are brief, momentary glimpses of something beyond our understanding, in which we are shown just how frail we are in our day-to-day existence.  As for the social aspect of this game, don't bother. Before too long, you too will turn into one of those awful hunched over denizens that shuffle along the virtual pathways of the game, desperately hoping to find others who will help you overcome a game. Because playing with so-called  friends  turns DotA from a brief stroll through a mysterious wasteland into a grind that makes the most mindnumbing job seem free spirited and joyful. Playing DotA in a team is the equivalent of dropping out of school and joining a gang in order to make it in the world. You go from being tossed along the current with things out of your control to being surrounded by people at the first sign, will drop you for another who seems slightly more put together. Playing DotA with friends will drop you into a  Lord of the Flies -esq setting, in which you will be fighting with you fellow man just to make it in the world. Everything you ever knew and loved will slowly decay and turn to dust as you force yourself to get further and further ahead, while slipping further and further behind.  In short, 7/10, play with your friends or not at all.",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"PS2 is awesome in a way that BF and CoD is not, since there're no sessions, up to 2000 players possible in one battle (greatest battle so far: 442 players), and the teamwork and coordination needed to win a battle.

If you are a fan of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, you will probably get about 1 hour or less of entertainment from Goat Simulator. I have 3.2 hrs played, and It probably will never get above 3.5. The levels are very small, and you can run around each one in a minute or two. The only objective in the game is to destroy things and cause mayhem, getting points and combos which unlock new 'goats' and new goat powers which you can optionally turn on. These new goats and powers only add the slightest amount of variety, as the level you are in has all the same things to interact with that it already did. I imagine that you would need a very short attention span to enjoy this, because literally all you can do in the game is headbutt and flail around, its fun for about 10 minutes, and then if youre really bored you go around the level to find the numerous buggy and glitchy 'easter eggs', which are really the only content. These do not accomplish anything in adding to the game, its the old makeup on a pig.  To sum it up, its a joke that is probably funniest when you see a video of someone play it, the fun level only goes down from there, it feels like something I should not have paid for.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"i like this game, i honestly do. but after the level 15 lobbys were everything is square off and even i got tossed into a lobby with level 30's through late 50's doing what i read one guy complain about in another comment on this thread 'Afking in their spawn point parrying all your attacks' which i thought was a bit of a laugh at the time, but had to have some truth. and the few matches i did do after pretty much resulted in the same thing you'd have the same group of people sitting in a corner waiting for those few lucky fellows who try to come to them and cut him down and continue in all chat and the game voices. kinda killed the 'Warfare' vibe when its 2 guys parrying eachother over social media banter.  not saying don't buy this game, but after you have your fun 0-15 be prepared to be thrown to the dogs, because after they figure out you have 17 hours in the game compared to their 300,657,1300 hours. you are singled out by those few on sight because you know 1/10th of the expliots they do.  aside from whats been said i do enjoy the game still, the combats great. but theirs no real way to shatter someones parry and the kick is broken, even if you tap F it wont 'light kick' like it says, you gotta hold it for heavy kick and by then they've traded 1-2 hits for your little shove, though it should only be used to break blocks, even after breaking a block its already back up by the time you finsih swinging a weapon, and small fast weapons can be used to stunlock you to death without you being able to give a single swing back which i find to be a bit much.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"***DISCLAMER: I think the game is fantastic overall and I am a huge fan of the entire total war series. That said I would not recomend buying this game until it is on sale for at least 50% off*****   Buying this game is like buying a puzzle that only came with a third of its pieces while the remaining two thirds of its pieces being kept behind various pay walls. I feel the need to discourage buying this game for full price is because I cant justify the utter lack of content in the base game. Rather than ranting I will just list my complaints:  * $60 for 4 races with a 5th if you ordered early. (Even if you factor in the fact that each race has a different look for every unit and a different play style that shouldnt justify the utter content drought, and especialy not ~$20 race DLC's.)  *A DLC sized Campaigne map. (I get that the warhammer world is huge, but why does that justify makeing the game a trilogy. Why not just give a bit of fan service and put the whole world in from the base game, and if you must have DLC's then make unique senarios.   *Expencive DLC's which offer features that should have been in the base game. (I wont even bother making any further comments on this, just look at their blood and gore DLC comment section, because everything I could say about this has already been said.)  I only critisize this game because I love it, but buying this game and its DLC's for full price is essentialy telling Creative Assemblies that its behavior is ok. I wont go as far as to say I would never buy a total war game again, but this was the last total war game I will ever pre-order.  ",-1,0,0

There are 18 radio towers to scale as you make your way through the game, each of which highlights new objectives on your map and opens up new weapons to buy at local shops, and each tower is a unique first-person climbing challenge - a peaceful ascent through a creaking spiral of steel that's fraying at the edges, revealing beautiful panoramic views before sending you back down to earth on a thrilling zipline.",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game is Great! Total War Warhammer has captured the grit and emersion in realtime battles of the previous instalments while adding the only niche left outside of the historical benchmark. I love the units and how we must manage their unfamiliar traits. This is not your grandpa’s Total War!   People complain about the DLC and price. Although I agree, I don’t think that should effect my review of the game itself.   My only complaint is the AI in campaign mode. Anything above easy creates a situation where you are attacked by 2 or more full sized armies (Chaos and whatnot) at all times which makes it hard to defend or attack any faction larger than 3 territories. The relentlessness of the AI makes it at times impossible to build up structures to advance your army and economy (unless you are Chaos or Beastmen).

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I don't usually write reviews, but I do like this game and hope it could be better.  Pros: This game is fun. It would be worth paying money for if they fix the problems.  Cons: There are a lot of bugs that indicate a lack of polish * I can't set my screen resolution for fullscreen to anything but my native desktop resolution. Workaround is to set game to windowed mode with a set resolution via steam launch options then set to fullscreen after login. There is a change resolution option in the game, but it doesn't have any options but my desktop res. * When attpempting to join a game that is full, a chunk of code error shows up rather than a message saying the game is full. Not a problem, but seems like something that would be trivial to fix. * Game objectives that show up on the map sometimes have game error text rather than actual names * There is apparently a known bug on arena team matches where you sometimes don't spawn. Based on other posts it has been around a long time and is quite common. * Players in team matches can apparently have skins/colors that override the team color, so the only way to tell what team they are on is to mouse over them and see if the dot is red. This is rediculous. * Performance on a lot of maps is terrible, mainly because they make them large with tons of detail. We don't really care how pretty the game looks, we'd rather it not chop. * Archer is quite frustrating to play. Quite often shots go right through people without hitting them. * Block seems to be able to block attacks even from behind if attacking with a slash, and from multiple opponents. * There is no cost to being blocked. If two people keep blocking/attacking each other, it will continue endlessly, pretty much regardless of weapon speed (dagger might be the only exception.) I've heard it's supposed to attack faster after you block (riposte) but if it's there it's too miniscule to matter. Think Assassin's Creed swordfighting without having a counter attack.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"The most epic F2P PvP shooter out there. Organized mess with about 100 guys fighting over a base, trying to capture it. 20 tanks, 10 jets and 50 armed men on foot. just wow. 3 factions, each with its own indivudal playstyle, weapons, vehicles. Some faction may have better vehicles than others but on the other hand they can lack on the force of their infantry weapons so there is always a balance and you can play faction which you like, not just which is strong. Some people may not trust F2P games, but this example of the perfect F2P game. microtransactions are not needed, shop offers comsetic items, xp and ingame currency boosters and weapons which you can all unlock with ingame currency. This game has a really neat ingame currency system- each 250 xp you gain 1 Cert point (ingame currency). This means the better you play the more money you will have.And theres a lot of opportunities to earn money- killing, assisting, spotting, damaging vehicles, airplanes, killing at longe range, objective capturing and the list goes on and on. It may be a grind but once you will learn to be most effective at the certain situation money should not be a problem. Comunnity of this game is for me as a lone wolf player somewhat between ok and nice- you can and you will occasionally kill someone on your side, but thats not a problem, just apologise and everything is ok, most people even dont bother with it. No frequent insults and ***holes as far in my 450 hours journey, so thats nice I think.   Pros -Massive scale of maps, battles and continents -Nice graphics -3 factions with its own playstyle -Great community -No need to spend real money -Sony sometimes gives away promo codes for free weapons, boosts, etc..  Cons -The game is very greedy, so its possible that people with not so good PC wont be able to play it -The ingame currency may have slower income for novice players -Sometimes very time consuming as you cant afford to take a dump when there is a huge battle and every single man counts.  10/10 ",1,0,1

Consider how much of the prev titles are gone, and how much assets is being reused and just reskinned, the only efford goes into armies and their units, which isnt a very large roster.   There is also a clear downgrade in graphics quality, and there is also a bit of a lie in recommended specs, my pc would run 60+ on ultra, it never did, and still does not. And they got no idea why, which leads me to believe they just put some specs up and wrote it as recommended 60+ fps specs. Otherwise how else can they not have seen this?

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I can't even be bothered highlighting the great points, yeah its a good game but its essentially a bad clone of Warhammer: Battle March. This game doesn't contain half of the playable races or units that Battle March did, the siege combat is actually worse than in BM and when playing as Chaos in BM you can actually destroy towns and buildings whilst battling armies in canon locations where as here you just beat the enemy army and 'pillage' the town with a simple left click.  The game is good but the fact that I can find better points in a game of the same universe from 8 years ago should give an indicator of its current state. Its a fun game and I enjoy the scope of the universe you play in, its also very true to the lore however, if you want to play a good Warhammer game play Battle March, if you're after a Total War game with Warhammer elements then, sure, pick up a copy but not for full price or maybe wait for the next 10 DLCs so you actually get a complete Warhammer game.   Edit: $3 US To add blood lmao",-1,0,0
570,Dota 2,"I've played dota for eight or nine years. It is fun and worth the time and effort to learn.   Unfortunately, Dota 2 is currently maimed by an idiotic matchmaking system that punishes you for winning. That's right, punishes you. You win a few games, get over fifty percent w/l, and then all of a sudden you're getting match with guys that don't speak english and fail to understand even basic concepts of the game. Then, when you lose a ♥♥♥♥ load and your winrate is down to forty eight or forty nine percent, you're magically tossed back into a group of people that actually know what they're doing. Then you get a win streak, and get some wins and get out of the hole.   Then the cycle starts all over again. There is no way around it. No amount of always taking a carry, or always taking mid, or always waiting to pick to get what your team needs is going to help you improve your w/l rate. It is rigged, and it is frustrating.  There is also no excuse for the servers for english speaking people to always be flooded with people that don't speak english. This is not racism, this is common sense. You're playing a team based game so you need to be able to communicate with your team. It is ignorant of Valve to allow non-english speakers on the servers in such overwhelming numbers, as that it ruins the play experience for all involved. ",-1,1,0

I felt it was missing some of the MMO charm (such as industry to build your own aircraft, for example).  It's still a good time.

The Chivalry community is tiny and elitist and hostile towards new players and foreign points of view. The fight mechanics are exploitable the community overly sensitive and competitive. With guys just wanting to have fun its great, with the try hard fan boy wannabe pro gamer crowd that is the majority of commited players in the servers outside the starting ranks its the opposite. The forums even have moderators slinging nasty little comments at new players that this isn't the game for them, breaking their arms patting themselves on the back for their amazing skills. Telling new players learning the exploits is like growing up, missing the irony of people playing a video game and taking that seriously talking about growing up.

Aircraft control physics feel like the change with every few updates, very unsettling for frequent pilot players, and while the theme of the UI remains the same.

The game is by no means terrible and many people still enjoy it however it is nowhere near the quality it was when it first came out. massive battles that could spontenously occur anywhere have been reducted to predictable skirmishes at predetermined points to cater to a Generation Z player base used to instant gratification and reward for failure.

I'm not a fan of them. When I accidently got charged $40 for an auto-renewal that I wasn't aware of, I quickly asked them if they could refund me the money and reverse the whole transaction and experience etc (given that I hadn't been logged in previous to the auto-renewal, this should have been easy). They sent me a very lengthy email back rudely stating it wouldn't be reversed. Period. I was wrong. It was autorenewal. It's my fault I wasn't aware of it. Blah blah blah.-Given it was $40, I took this issue to my credit card company. Now I can't log into my account at all. No email sent by SOE notifying me or explaining the reasoning. In total roughly $70 down the drain on a game I can't play.... At least I no longer am supporting those ♥♥♥-holes working there.  2) While they aren't offering high-end items for $, they are offering high-end items only to those that have saved up an insane amount of credits, I'm talking months of work for one item 1k credit item... unless you are paying for the credits or for a monthly subscription that would provide you with an experience boost to get the credits you are needing.",-1,0,0

I'm fine with cinks and bugs, I freely participate in Beta releases like Hots, Reborn, Windows 10 etc. It's not the bugs, it's all these changes, that has made me hesitate to double-click the Dota icon for me. After 700+ hours Dota takes away levels and gives me an icon that changes when I level up. Great but now the one match I'm playing with people with 1000+ hours and it's how Dota always was. Next, a match with people who don't even have a steam profile yet. The experience mmr bracket is ruined by the new levelling system incorporated into this chaos.  The T5I is over and the compendium rewards are STILL buffering. We were supposed to get them easily 4-5 months ago. 'There have been compatibility issues regarding the desert terrain and the axe immortal is still being made', fine you're busy, but then why rush a pre-beta then and release several treasury items when we're still waiting for what we paid for since the beginning of 2015?  I'm not saying it's a horrible game, I'm saying it's not what it was and I don't like the direction it's going into. It changed too much too quickly, it's missing several key factors that is being pushed aside for the illusion of progress.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I love Warhammer, i played the board game where you had to pay hundreds of dollars to play little monsters you had to paint yourself. Great hobby.  I played Warhammer online where you had to buy the game and subscribe 15-20$ / month. I played it for as long it has been active. It is still my favorite game of all times, i miss it.  I played pretty much all Total Wars except Napoleon and Atila. I still play them when i feel like it.  This opus is an insult to both fanbases. I played the greenskin campain and loved it. Greenskin was my army on table, i love them. The game looks great, the concept of total war is amazing and the world of warhammer is just mindblowing but that is where it stops.  Count with me :  100$ For the main title. 10$ For a Race that kicks your ♥♥♥ in the campain wether you bought the DLC or not... in short, for content that is already in the game. 5$ For blood ... in warhammer/total war/21th century war game... seriously... shame on you. 20$ For 1 New Race... 20% (1/5) of the price of the main title for 1 race.  and if they go all in Warhammer, the following races are still missing :  -Bretonia -Skavens -Lizard men -Chaos Dwarfs -Dark elves -High elves -Wood elves -The Ogres  Also note that:   when they say buy the Chaos faction, they are selling 1/3 of the actual Chaos branch. The Beastmen are an other 3rd of it. So they splited the chaos in 2 different DLCs so far, the Deamons of Chaos are still missing, unless you consider the very few units to be 2 factions merged in one.   The undead branch has 2 factions, so we should expect the Tomb Kings.  I hope you are smart enough to understand what I and so many others are saying here. Buy the game, it's fun, warhammer is awesome. But the business model behind it is an aberation and a scam.  Estimated total price without discount : 400$ give or take. Are you that rich ? It is getting ridiculous. Watch piracy come back big time in the next 10 years.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'm not sure what to say about this game. It's hilarious, and gives you many many hours of entertainment and what seems like a deep and intricate combat system. However, on the one hand, once you play it for a while, you realize how horribly, horribly buggy and easy it is to abuse the combat system. Once you discover how to slow down your attacks as a Vanguard, it's almost impossible for 70% of all players to defeat you.  The game has been out for over two years. It quickly got a lot of hype and attention from big YouTubers, but despite the massive cash-in the devs got they're evidently pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ at their job. The peasants are all identical, the kick animation is clunky and the kick mechanic itself is often downright broken. It's remarkable that Torn Banner got the combat system quite rightly addictive and still not polish their game. There are still places you can clip through, get stuck; maps can break and have had the same glitches since they were introduced. Third person is literally allowed, for some inexplicable reason, granting players objective advantage over others, making this the ultimate way to play - which is a glaring problem, to say the least, when the game is advertised as a FIRST PERSON slasher.  All this total nonsense leads me to believe that the devs really have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what they're doing. Do they even play their own game, realizing the problems that exist? It's not even debatable that third person is the best way to play. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, if you play in third person and master it then you WILL be better than someone on that same level playing in first person.  The devs just got lucky with a solid combat formula. I'm sad to admit I've nearly spent 300 hours on the game and nearly every match there is a bug or a glitch or a balance problem that ruins it. It's been two years since the game got out of beta. I don't ♥♥♥♥ing understand how they can add more maps and fail to add unique voice commands to those maps, as was included in every vanilla map.  What the hell kind of budget do these people operate with anyway. The instance there comes along a game that is the same but is actually focused on first person I will switch, and I will also uninstall this crap. I cringe seeing it on my games list.   For a slight bit of perspective on how broken this game is at its core, here is a video:         YouTube™ Video:  Chivalry Abuse&nbsp;",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 has many glaring issues. The most immediate is the horrific and broken Uplay DRM that is forced, despite this being the steam version of the game. The only upgrades in this game compared to it's predecessor are the graphics, voice acting, and general production values. The writing is simply laughable, quite possibly one of the worst stories I have experienced, the fact that Jeffrey Yohalem got nominated for a BAFTA for this game goes to show that becoming a writer in the modern video game industry requires only the bare minimum of credentials. I'm not even going to go into the plot because it's basically non existent beyond 'Uh hey he's bad, let's get em'! *takes shrooms*' The only character that has even marginally interesting writing is Vaas, and they hyped him up so much prerelease that practically every single one of his lines can be found in a trailer, and without his VA's fantastic performance it would probably not be half as interesting. Jason Brody &amp; Co. are so obnoxious, that they are for all intents and purposes, a parody of themselves. Jason Brody, whose name itself is cringeworthy, goes from sheltered rich junkie ♥♥♥♥♥boy to a v-neck and tribal tattoo-clad hard 'killer' within the space of one mission and an overall story mode that lasts about two weeks in game time that is divided up into chapters, which we are greeted by with loading screens with forced 'Alice in Wonderland' excerpts that aren't actually relevant to the story beyond 'Woohoo I'm wacky, crazy, and insane Haha!'. The game's theme of insanity is not explored or expounded upon, just stated over and over again, no really, they just keep telling you the webster-merriam definition of the word. The irony is almost next level.    The shooting mechanics are vastly improved in this iteration with a few exceptions. 1. There is virtually no recoil on any of the weapons 2. Most if not all of the gun sounds, are in fact, not gun shots. Which in this day and age for a AAA game with a massive budget, is simply not acceptable, the PKM sound is like a note from a skrillex song.   Despite Far Cry 2's 'Heart of Darkness' derivative story, and cheap voice acting, the choose-able silent protagonists of varying backgrounds including ex-KLA members and IRA insurgents is able to be taken much, much more seriously in it's African setting that is reflective of the varying local wars and conflicts fueled by ethnic and religious tensions, blood minerals, and separatist sentiments that are and have been occuring for the past 50 or so years in Africa.   So basically unless you just really, really like playing as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ druggie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with tribal tats that changes personality traits more often than my insane bipolar grandmother, and having the NPCs color coded for you to Red = Bad and Blue = Good, pick up Far Cry 2 instead, it has many flaws of its own, but they are acceptable given the context that they are symptoms of its age and budget. Far Cry 3 does everything it does in the most pedestrian and shallow approach the devs could have taken from the UI to the story.",-1,0,0

I was really buying this game expecting to play mostly online and have a general for each faction to upgrade and customize with different weapons, armours, magics and skills.   Pros:  Well optimised and great graphics Quests, touturials, objectives are the best designed from any TW game (until later game and it all breaks) Distinctive factions with their own gameplay mechanics Addition of Magic to generals Almost no bugs  Cons: Unfinished game. You need to pay for the rest in the form of 'DLC' Even though you paid for the game already. No thought given to Multiplayer No small settlement battles No unit formation options No ammo types Limited Unit types for each faction Limited upgrades/armour etc for units Badly balanced later game mechanics (The game balance is great until around turn 50 and then everything goes haywire)  The Verdict: A dissapointment.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'd only recommand this game if you've already seen gameplay and you know it's a game you'd like. Don't buy it only because it's on sale on Steam. I've wanted this game almost a year and, yet, I've been on the brink of abandoning many times in the few 15 hours I've played. The game can be very fun once you get to level 30-40, but you got to be motivated to get that far.  Review:   Chivalry Mediavel Warfare is a very competitive, skill-based game with a medieval atmosphere. The combat are realistic and fast-paced. With 4 classes and over 60 weapons, you're almost sure to find a build that suits your fighting style. The game is based on skill and practice. You unlock weapon by using other weapons of the same category. The only things you can unlock with money is cosmetic, so it's not a Pay-To-Win. It has 5 interesting gamemodes and custom maps and mods.   Pro:  -Based on skill and practice. You can not pay to have upgrades you must practice to get better. -Dragging, Matrixing and other such things are very fun to learn and use in fights, even if they bugs. -Very fun, once you know how to fight. -Lots of different builds possible. -Team Objective, Team Deathmatch, Last Team Standing and Duel are fun and very easy to get better. -Nice graphics.   Con:  -Lots of hackers and team-killers on beginner servers- unintentional for the latter. And when you accuse someone of hacking, other people say you're a newbie and you don't know the game. -Lots of intentional team-killers on normal servers. -There is a huge difference of skills between beginner servers and normal servers. -The community can be very toxic with its hackers, team-killers, ragers and other such people. -If you've got a high ping or more than 10-15% team damage, you're gonna get kick. -It's very long and hard to be good. It took me 10 hours to be half-way decent on beginner servers. It takes hundred of hours to be good on normal server. And all the while you're gonna get destroy by better people and end the game with 2/23/4. -The devs have stopped working on the games. That means all the little annoying bugs aren't going to get fixed. On the other side, positive bugs suchs as dragging aren't gonna get removed either.   Beginner tips:  -First thing you should do after buying the game is the Training Map. Go in Training then Training Map. It shows you have to block, attack, combo, feint and how to play the different classes. It's very useful at the beginning. -Use a shield. Don't hold it in position all the time but use it to block more easily until you get used to the speed of the weapons and dragging. -If you're playing as a Vanguard or a Knight, don't side-swing in team games. You're gonna end up killing more allies than ennemies and get kick. -If you like to do a lot of burst damage and have a good defense, pick Knight. If you like to do a lot of damage and keep your distance use Vanguard. If you like to attack very fast use Man-At-Arm. -Don't play Archer until you're used to blocking with a sword. Archer is the hardest class to master. -Stick to beginner servers until you're level 10 to 15. But don't wait until you're 16 to play on normal server or it'll be twice as hard.",-1,0,0

I has a rich storyline, with a lots of characters, heart booming events, and an awesome atmosphere.  Singleplayer, as I said, is the best part on this game. There are alots of exciting missions, side missions, quests, and colletcting items aswell, such as collecting hide of animals to craft holsters, plants to craft medicine, or just find collectable stuff, like Relics, Letters and other stuff. There are also a lots of minigames, like poker, racing, ski jet racing, shooting... If you dont like storylines, and rather explore, or do random stuff, you can still enjoy this game.  Multiplayer isnt really the best. Its still a lot of fun though, although if Ubisoft took care about it a bit more, it would have been a lot better. Its fun to do the missions, but the story of the multiplayer campaign is a bit short. Its still fun to play it, especially at harder difficulty, where its also a bit challenging.  Overall, I rate this game 8 / 10. Its awesome at singleplayer, but a bit boring on multiplayer",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"Having experience in other Moba's (LoL, HoN, HotS, and the original Dota), and having given Dota 2 a decent shot in learning its mechanics, I will go ahead and say that the game is in many ways broken. To list a few;  - When being killed you lose gold to your enemy, creating a power vacuum between two players that is extremely hard to recover from.  - Some heroes are completely unviable compared to others that are simply broken.  - The ranges of heroes vary from close quarters to extreme distance, making certain heroes without range nor mobility moves struggle heavily early game.  - Every item seems to have an active which makes keeping track of all your 'moves' a chore,more often than not having to juggle an entire second set of moves. Thankfully almost every Hero has a passive ability.. however this ultimately takes away from the uniqueness of a Hero.  - The delay between clicking and the Hero using their auto-attacks when starting the game is quite massive, along with how they seemingly glue themselves to the floor while doing it. This can apply to moves as well.  - Warding seems to be very static and uncreative.  - Having to buy an item that allows you to go back to base or into lane is a poor idea when you consider the first point (death causing loss of gold), on top of the fact that it takes a slot in your inventory.  There are many more issues that I had with the game but these were the main ones that drove me away. Ultimately, teamfights felt detached, farming was bland, the UI hurt my head with all the clutter, and the community was inhospitable at best. I advise anyone looking for a balanced, fun, or fair Moba to stay far away from Dota 2.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"TLDR  Pro - Incredibly lore faithful - Fun factions and battles - Beautiful Map  DLC - Questionable, but not overwhelming, DLC model  As somebody who has kept in touch with the Warhammer Fantasy Battle lore off and on since the early 00's I have to say that CA has done a wonderful job staying true to what always drew me to the series. WFB games come and go, some better than others, but it's the story behind them that remains their greatest strength. CA has taken this concept and run with it. The entire game - though another title in the Total War series - drips with Warhammer flavor. From the specific faction mechanics to the unique army compositions I have personally enjoyed every game of TW: W I've played (even the losing ones). Artillery is a special favorite for me, I always find myself laughing when I see a Greenskin take a direct hit from a Dwarf Cannon, or an Empire line break against Goblin Doom-divers.  The terrain is beautiful, how it changes based on which faction controls it is such an interesting touch that makes the world feel more alive than a simple map. The in-battle scenery is eye catching as well. CA has done a wonderful job at capturing the magnitude of the Old World in its varied battle maps.  The only negative I have with the title is the DLC model. I can see the game being fairly expensive a year down the road, I hope (but don't expect) the price of DLCs to reduce over time to allow an easier entry for newer players years down the road. Paying their prices isn't a problem for me, but if there was any negative I had to list - this would be it.",1,0,1

I recommend Chivalry Medieval Warfare to anyone who likes multiplayer fps (altough the S in fps here means more slasher than shooter ?) Anyways....  On the other hand, I'd recommend Dealiest Warrior only to the people who want to have fun with classic fantasy roles like ninjas, pirates and so on, and that strictly like the fighting part, because the games can get boring quite fast if you'd like to complete objectives to make your team advance in the next part of the map and such...

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I dont play (ok, played) this on my PC but on my Tablet.. I thought I write my warning here..  The game is a time waster.. very good one.. and became with the last update even MORE time waster. Let me explain. The game is a resource game.. running in real time. You can play it clicking your ♥♥♥ off, play it idle and do nothing at all beside a few clicks every here and then.. or a mix of both.  I played a mix, as sometimes I want to click a bit and other times I prefer to sleep! :p So for 5 days I wasted my time.. and I felt very sorry for myself during game time.. why am I wasting my life with this? Anyhow.. got myself a little setup and reached Lv400 in 50min on my farm run for hero souls. Got about 350 on average on a run. Skilled mainly chance to spawn a Primal Boss and Hero Souls drop amount plus more gold in IDLE mode. I was happy wasting my time... and the update came.. no question, do you want to upgrade? Just suddenly I got way more Hero Souls.. niiiice, what a lucky run.. when I hit over 1k Souls.. I started to understand, something goes different as usual. Bed time.. started game again next day and screen pops up.. Transcence bla bla.. Help Screen to explain it all.. like a lerner driver gets this instruction: Open Door of the car, start car, drive as it is demanded by law, park and exit car. So.. basicly nada! Next I start my run.. why are my heroes not guilded anymore?? Why does all take soooooooo much longer? To make it short.. that is what r2games sold you. We made a upgrade and BALANCED the game. How unbalanced it was before.. example: My next upgrade for chance to get a primal boss was 72 Hero Souls... after the update +86k Hero souls.. so the developper thought it needed a balance to a skill that was 1 : 1200 out of balance. Yes, but we gave you more Hero Soul income too... true.. went from 400 average to 1500 on a run.. lets say 4 time more... to 1200 more cost.. my same farm run of 50min is now over 3 hours... and instead of beeing able to upgrade my chance for hero boss 3 times on one farm run to 400.. I would need over 50 runs for 1 upgrade. So wasting time is one thing, this is just simply super stupid.. I guess to many people came to the end of 'get arthritis when you are old game'.. and instead of putting some brain into it.. they just made everything a s h i t l o a d take more time.  So all in short: If you want to kill your last brain cells with boredom, if you cant understand or play games, which demands at least an IQ of 90.. this is your game and you will LOVE it!!! In any other case.. do yourself a favor, man... drill yourself a hole in your head.. makes more sense than playing this game for brain dead idiots. This is THE game for street cleaners, garbage men and bums living under the bridge.. about the IQ you need to play this junk and think this is a great game..",-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"the first fallout game i played, Fallout 3 incredible main story, awsome side quests, and massive nonlieniar atmosphiric open world make this one of the best games i've ever played. After playing both new vegas and fallout 4, i found that in terms of story, atmosphere ,and side quests, fallout 3 is the clear winner dispite in my opinion not being as overall good as fallout 4 (but still 500x better then new vegas, seriously i have no idea what obsidian was thinking when they implemented ceasars legion or thought that the game had an acceptable main quest.) The only true flaw i find in fallout 3 is the actual writing and dialoge that goes with its incredible story, at times its has that nice simple feel to it that might remind you of dialoge beween saturday morning action cartoons (childish, but at the same time awsome,) other times it just is downright childish and rather lazy (seriously, one of the many ways to kill the main villan is to convince him that he is insane, and he just kills himself, yeah its very hard to pass the speech check, but its still rather silly way to destroy a rather awsome villian.) Overall fallout 3 is a gameing masterpeice, combining rpg elements from the first 2 games with (at the time of its relese) modern fps mechanics to bring a new standard to the fallout franchise, a standard that set the foundation for fallout new vegas and Fallout 4.",1,1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Due to the state of the game's current performance, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.   WARNING - Long review below. Here's a quick TL; DR for the more impatient types :  'Despite promises by developers, the game is as poorly optimized as ever. DX12 is not included at launch, and multi-core CPU-support is no better than before. The game also has numerous performance-bugs limiting the experience further. This poor performance renders me unable to recommend the game.'  ---  Since after the release of 'Empire: Total War' in 2009, the  Total War -games have gained a reputation for being poorly optimized, especially on more modern computers. Amongst other things, this has to do with the games running on a seven year-old engine that wasn't at the time built to make full use of technology like multi-core CPUs, despite the games by their very nature being extremely CPU-heavy. Thus, for a great many people, the very first question that needs answering whenever a new  Total War -game is announced or released, is 'how will it run?'.      In the time running up to the game's release, the developers made several announcements promising significant improvements to the engine; improvements that would supposedly lead to superior performance. By far chief among these, were  improved support for multi-core CPUs , and  DX12-support .      A few days before launch, the developers released a statement informing that the game would  not  support DX12 at launch, after all. This will supposedly be patched in at an unknown later date. In addition,   DSOGaming.com   released a performance-analysis reporting that the news of improved multi-core CPU-scaling was blatantly untrue - the game is as poorly optimized as ever, maxing out only one or two cores. This is possibly linked to the removal of DX12-support.       http://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/total-war-warhammer-pc-performance-analysis/       Having tested the game for about a solid hour, I can confirm this. I can also report a number of bugs and glitches that decreases performance further - at least on my system. I also haste to add that my computer is way above the official system-requirements for 'Ultra' game settings. (According to the developers, my computer should easily be able to run a battle with 20 regiments per side on max graphical settings in 60 FPS; this is blatantly and demonstrably untrue.)       The following are my personal experiences with fighting a number of 20 vs. 20-regiment Custom Battles.   At its  very best  - and not taking any of the numerous performance-related bugs and glitches into the equation - the game appears to perform about the same as  Total War: ATTILA ; both for me, and others I've spoken to. This makes sense, seeing as there does not appear to be any immediately significant graphical difference between the two titles, save for minor spit-shines like improved reflective surfaces on metal. For me, personally, this translates to about 30-35 FPS when zoomed close to the ground, assuming the camera isn't moving and the troops on-screen aren't fighting. When multiple regiments are engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the performance will typically drop to about 20 FPS. It can drop down to 15-10 FPS if said regiments are clustered closely together, for some reason.      This is, of course, assuming the game runs flawlessly. It doesn't.      Performance-related bugs include huge stuttering when the camera moves at any significant speed or in any significant distance, FPS taking a dive whenever even a single Spell is cast, and mysterious and seemingly arbitrary permanent frame-drops. And this is occurring  all the time . The FPS-counter races up and down like a rollercoaster.      In one example, I was zoomed in on a mêlée taking place between three or four regiments at the far left of the battlefield. The FPS hovered at around  20 . I then moved the camera to the opposite end of the battlefield and viewed the exact same scene from there, and the FPS dropped to  10-7 . When I then moved the camera back to the original position, the game  stayed at around 8 FPS . Already poor performance made worse with bugs.      ---   Final words .      The general track record and business practices of the developers, combined with the state of the game's performance, renders this game something I am sadly completely unable to recommend. I am going to apply for a refund, and can only suggest that people with similar issues do the same. Voting with your wallet is after all the only real way to enact change.      I did not pre-order the game, and this is the exact reason why. I am going to re-purchase the game whenever DX12-support is patched in, and will update my review accordingly.         My computer .      Two TITAN Zs in SLI. (Latest drivers.)  Intel Core i7-5820k.  ASUS X99-PRO.  32GB RAM.  Game runs from a fast SSD.  Windows 10 Pro 64-BIT.     Disclaimers .      My computer is completely free of viruses; all other games run fine; I have tried verifying the integrity of the game's cache; re-installed the game twice, and made sure all drivers are updated.",-1,1,0
570,Dota 2,"This game is nothing other than money grab. Valve is too busy creating cosmetics for easy money to fix bugs that have been in the game for years like creeps following you through fog of war or a more recent game breaking bug that causes the screen to freeze and turn completely white in the middle of the game forcing you to restart Dota with no guarantee that the game was paused. You can also expect to be put in low priority games about once a week because it currently takes around 3 reports in 20 games to send you to low prio. That is 3 people reporting you out of the possible 180. The game is centered around competitive play to the point that there is really no reason to play if you don’t intend on getting better. However the ranking system is currently the simplest and most inadequate of any “competitive” game out there if you win you get +25 MMR if you loss -25 no matter your performance. Go 15/2 as a phoenix that started the game as a support then was forced in to the carry role because you’re the only one that isn’t currently 0/10 clearly you’re not a good player or you could have won that game. The ranking system is so awful that a black market of accounts has popped up so now any scrub with 20 bucks can buy an account in your ranking were he doesn’t belong and give you 0% chance of winning the game. I wouldn’t consider getting in to the game at its current state 12,000,000 players and it’s still a buggy mess with incompetent players that are unavoidable at any skill level.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a very depressing game. Think of it as cocaine. Once you touch this game, it kinda draws you in and keep you playing, which will devour so much of your time, and it is very hard to get out of that.  Why it is depressing? The community is the biggest reason, you will get flamed, cursed and reported for the mistake that you make by other players. As a result, you will develop into a person who becomes very salty(Classic exmaple EG.PPD) and rage easily.  And you get to play with Peruvian!! They are the worse teammates that you can have. They like to play on us server from Peru with more than 100ping, no thought they are bad, Since this is a team game, they are lack of teamwork (AFK farming) and communication ('jajajaja' is what they talk). They give out easily and often result into a rage quit. I really hope Valve could do something about this, maybe regional lock-out so they could not enter us serve.  I do NOT recommend this game right now until any improvement has been made about the community.   I talk from thousand hours of game play and 5.4k mmr.  ",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Picked this up for 5 euro on the Steam sale - Wouldn't advise getting it for much more than that.  The combat is fun and hitting people over the head with a sword is cathartic - It's especially satisfying if you do it right and it all comes out in your favour. There are a lot of FPS games which claim to include close combat, but none feel as visceral or as strong as the central combat of Chivalry. The game has simple Battlefield-esque rules in multiplayer (Or just plain free-for-all) which seems fair enough. The plot also stands up in the sense that it doesn't over-complicate.   The thing is, it looks like a game that was intended to be single player but at some point someone realise that the AI was too bad to roll out with a single player campaign, and it became entirely multiplayer dependant. Which seems great now, but for all I know a few weeks down the line nobody else will be playing or the servers will fill up with people flaming. For now the multi-player stands up, but that doesn't change the fact that when I want to play single player, I end up with a wide open space with the two teams sitting on opposite ends, facing the wall and twitching. There are also more than a few corners in which one can get trapped by jumping at the wrong angle.  Then there's the fact that it's a 15 euro indie title which appears to have paid DLC for different helmets (Which at best you will only see from behind anyway). For a game that's already startlingly incomplete given its lack of decent AI and relatively small variety of maps to choose from. To me, this is Torn Banner getting a bit too big in their pantaloons.They need to make sure everything runs smoothly before they can think about releasing DLC.  So in short it's a really strong, fun game mechanic which doesn't seem to know quite what to do with itself, and it suffers from a sense of feeling a bit small, a bit unimmersive and not nearly as epic as the tralier intended.",-1,0,0

You scare people. You stick to things with your tongue. You can flip and do somersaults. You can ride a bicycle.  The game is actually an action game, and if you enjoy skateboarding games or games like GTA where you can run around and do tricks, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy Goat Simulator as well.  The graphics are fair, the gameplay at times hilarious. It isn't anything I play at any greater lengths of time, but for winding down for 30 minutes or if I don't have anything better to do, Goat Simulator is a great choice.

I attempted to try the game with a friend. As we went into a game, our cameras got stuck to the top right hand side of the screen. We could not move it and tried to play in first person. this then led us to learn that we could get one shotted by a single enemy.

The good news is that there's a mod project named 'Tale of Two Wastelands' which converts and imports Fallout 3 into Fallout: New Vegas.

I hate how dumbed down they made sieges and the whole chaos invasion is boring, i mean it was fun the first 2 times but after that its just the same thing over and over again, chaos invasion locks down whats going to happen in the game to much and really limits the replay value.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I wish Steam would allow a neutral or 50/50 option, because I neither want to recommend nor condem this game. I'll try not to spoil anything. I spent about 34-35 hours on my play through, so I spent a good amount of time exploring and doing other stuff besides the story, so this review isn't just a quick blaze through of the game.  Also, incoming wall of text, so if you were expecting a light read, then jog on.  It's another painfully average AAA title with tons of repetative side quests like Assassins Creed, except in FPS format. Ubisoft really need to let go of the 'Make everything like Assassins Creed so it sells' mentality. Assassins Creed only worked once, and that was the first game. Anything after that was a sham and a waste of time, but I digress.  'Exploration' pretty much consists of you activating or deactivating a radio towers, I don't really know which one it is. This reveals a little bit of the map around that particular tower. Then you have to clear out all the pirates from the surrounding camps in that area. Once you claim the area, you are given the choice of two side quests from each camp you liberate. 'Wanted Dead' or 'Hunting', they're both the same ♥♥♥♥ in each camp. 'Wanted Dead' entails you having to kill a pirate leader in a near-by camp with a knife. Nothing else, ever for the whole game. Just a knife. 'Hunting' is just killing animals with a bow and arrow. You can get all the upgrades for weapon holdsters, carry packs and whatever in about an hour of play time.  Gunplay feels like a step down from Far Cry 2. All the weapons felt nice to use and control and everything just clicked. But Far Cry 3s gunplay has almost zero recoil and you can just ♥♥♥♥ bullets in the direction of the enemy and they'll all fall over (I played through on hard difficulty). I would have given the gunplay a passing grade if weapon degredation and condition was brought back from FC2. That was so fun. Just having your gun jam or explode on you in a fight or having an RPG rocket just flop out the front of the launcher and spin around wildly in front of you was great and I really missed that mechanic. That and there is a severe lack of weapons in general. 4 per catagory and there's about 5 catagories. Some of the weapons look inaccurate to their real life counterparts. This is a massive boner kill for me, even if the game isn't supposed to be that realistic, the weapons need to look like they do IRL. Especially the AK47, it's HUGE, too long and has all these silly little ornate touches too it and it looks dumb.  The protag is a whiney little girly boy, sure a change from the usual macho meat-head bald super soldier space marines we've seen time and again through the PS3, 360 gen, but he was still boring to listen to, and play as. 'Oh god m-muh morals, muh fambily and muh friends'. The story itself is just through and through stupid.  Some of the supporting cast was better though, although almost ALL of them where some type of massive cliché. Some of the voice acting for some of the characters was really quite good. Sam, Hoyt and Vaas, for example. That brings me onto sound. I don't know what was wrong with the sound in the game, but some of the audio is really great quality, but then sometimes you'll hear villagers or minor NPCs with really wooden, fuzzy and almost unintelligible sound quality to their voices. Might be due to 'console limitations' or something, but it was really horrible in some places and made me think I had an issue with my soundcard at one point.  Graphically? It's alright. I don't play a game just because it looks nice. One thing I will say though, is that the facial rendering for main characters is really good. The environments are ok, but it's that typical 'lol tropical island' ♥♥♥♥♥ again. Tropical island has been done to death when it comes to HYPER GRAFIX games. Take it somewhere else. Oh and the water doesn't look that great.  One of the cooler elements of the game was the wildlife. Being pounced on by a Tiger or a bear while running through the bush is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing neat. Shark attacks sucked though.  Lots of QTEs, games automatically lose points for having QTEs. It's lazy. Stop putting it in games.  Forced scripted vehicle gunning sections. Personally I hate this ♥♥♥♥. You're bolted to a truck while the dumbass AI drives at 5mph and you get shot up because you can't strafe or duck to avoid incoming rounds and the like. LAME. Stop putting it in games.  'Enhanced perception' stims are overpowered as hell, abuse them.  There's a silly little bug or glitch in the game that allows the player to fall about 1-2ft after sliding down a small incline or jumping over a small rock, that'll just outright kill your player because it thinks you fell like 100ft or something.  No South African accents.  Hang gliding and wingsuiting is neat.  Menu and map theme is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying.  Too many stupid pop-culture references and 'lol xD meme' type dialouge.  Forcing me to play poker as part of the story. No one should ever be subjected to that ♥♥♥♥♥.  The majority of the 'tatau' skills are worthless and have no use, but you have to take some of them to get the ones you actually need.  Dubstep based soundtrack. I like dubstep, but that crap doesn't belong in video games.  You have to install and use Uplay to play the game, which is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and annoying.  Ending is totally phoned in.  Overall it's not a bad game, but it's not amazing either. It's middle of the road at best. But like all modern AAA games, it's marketed to hell and back and sold on hype, not the game itself.  4/10, no game ever gets 10/10, therefore 4/10 is an average score.

265930,Goat Simulator,"  Goat Nis Video Part 1 ~ At First Lick   [medavelvan.com]  When saw that there was a game called ‘Goat simulator’ on Steam, I smiled and I was immediately thankful that someone out there had the sense of humor and sufficient motivation to make a game with such an obstinant premise.  I almost bought it full price simply to support free-spirited developers like these; but I am happy that I refrained and waited for a sale. It’s a fun game, but not a good game.  Before playing ‘Goat Simulator’ I imagined the game in two flavors: either a realistic Goat Sim, where players would live the daily routine of a goat with normal goat missions: eat grass, escape fence, eat garden plants, evade farmer~ where the humor would arise from the realism of being a goat.  The second flavor would be an over-the- top, silly goat game with crazy game mechanics and wacky missions, ~ where the humor would be from the absurdity of it all. My first impression of ‘Goat Simulator’, as seen in  Goat Nis - Part One  [medavelvan.com]  confirmed that it was the latter:  ‘Goat Simulator’ is an over-the-top goat sim with wacky physics and unreasonable world interaction.  It is simply impossible to describe the level of absurdity present in every aspect of this game. A complete video review will be necessary in the near future when we have time to edit the highlights in our playthrough video.  In a nutshell, I recommend this game to gamers who like cheap sandbox games. This game is not an immersive rpg or GTA with goats, but it’s fun for $5 if you catch it during a Steam Sale.  ~Medavelvan  http://www.medavelvan.com ",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Please not that this review is by no means a reflection of the game in general, but more for an overlying issue: the fact that it is not optimized for any Windows OS newer than Vista.  Unlike New Vegas, which basically uses the same engine, older BGS games like Oblivion and Morrowind, or even Interplay's Fallout games of 1, 2 and Tactics, Fallout 3 generally will not run correctly, if at all, on Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10. While select few have been able to make the game run just through Compatiblity mode, the overall majority of users require numerous steps to go over and hoops to jump through. And even then, if you are in the minority of those like myself, you can still find yourself unable to play even after jumping through the hoops.  While the avid modder for Bethesda games might find it normal and only slightly more frustrating, the average user might just find it to be one massive headache. And again, they might just find it a waste of time if, like myself, can't seem to get it to actually start up a new game even with things like FOSE (Fallout Script Extender), G4WL Disabler (Games For Windows Live Disabler), a 4GB Patch, and the Unofficial FO3 Patch.  If you are one of those users who actually wants to put in the effort and see about getting it working, then there is a guide located here:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=149946772   The Guide itself is simple to understand, easy to follow, and contains links to nessecary additions to help get the game running.  However, it by no means ensures the game will work. While you could find success in the early steps, you could just find yourself stuck with nothing solving it.   If you are truely desperate in playing Fallout 3 again, but don't want to deal with the hastle of the steps in the guide, or are in the minority of users that, like myself, can't get it to run even with the steps in the guide, then you have one of two options. If you are and avid PC player and might even want to mod it, then find a good quality PC that is running Windows Vista. Or, if you don't care about mods, how it looks, or even what platform you play it on, then go down to your local Gamestop/EB Games, or whatever the store is called for you and purchase a PS3 or Xbox 360/Xbox One (as it is a backwards compatible title) and Fallout 3 Game of the Year edition, as the console versions still work fine.",-1,0,0

Pros:   - Super FUN!!!!  - Very Team Based Oriented   - Tons of Characters to play  - Tons of items during game (which are used to buff characters)  - A ridiculous amount of combinations from the above two   - Amazong community  - Pro leagues are phenomenal to watch!   I can go on for days about the pro's  Cons:  - There is a significant learning curve to this game  - The learning cuve just doesn't apply to the game, but to each character in the game as well.  - Can take a while to become decent with a character  - Play bad, get yelled at.... but thats what mute is for! =)  - Almost essential to have a microphone for vocal communication (theres almost no time to type while the game is going)  - If you have a bad team, you will almost always lose. There is no 'They're bad, but i can win it by myself.'  Overall I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is willing to spend a few hours to get used to the game before giving up on it. The game can be immensly fun after you get the hang of the game mechanics and a character or two. When you win..... it is super satisfying! Give it a try! =)",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"  Total war:Warhammer Review    This is my first long review that's gonna voice my opinion.    Rating&amp;Opinion   Total War: Warhammer is a really fun and great game, ever since I heard of it I have been wanting to get it! I have played this game for about 91 hours but hoping to add 909 more! I am also a HUGE total war fan and have played most of the games. but the reason you are reading is for my rating yes...I would give it a   8/10   now you might be wondering for this rating but this game leans more into the medieval 2 style of gameplay now I am sure lots of people like this but I have mixed views which I shall express later on in my review.    Gameplay  Now this is the most important part of the review, so this also matters should you purchase this game. because this is such a big part I will make it into smaller sections   Playable Races&amp;Factions  Non-dlc races   The Empire-Led on his fearsome mount:Deathclaw, Emperor Karl Franz leads the armies of the Empire to glorious victory against Vampire,Orks,Chaos and Beastmen! Having a very balanced army roster I am enjoying my campaign with them so far.  The Dwarves-My favorite little stunties, The High King Thorgrim GrudgeBearer leads the charge to take back lost holds and unite the Dwarves under one banner! The Dwarves have a very nice defensive roster with devastating units you will have trouble defeating the Greenskins as they get big quite fast, Playing as the Dwarves can be challenging as with no calvary you often can't run down troops nor block the enemy's.   I have a challenge for you   Playing as the Dwarves you must be cautious and try to win heroic or decisive victorys as every Dwarf life matters with the Longbeards outnumbering the Beardlings     The Greenskins-What a great campaign one of the best always on your feet being at war with someone, the end times just arrived word of advice, do not read spoiler: When the end times happens 4 full stacks will appear in the southern badlands so be ready to deal with chaos Okay back... in my current campaign everyone got the shield of civilization...except the orks, but I decided to make peace with everyone to take my 5 full stacks and attack chaos cuz its Grimgor Ironhide job to 'smash eads an crake skullz'  Vampire counts-I have not decided to play them yet as I find them a bit boring, sorry :(   Dlc Factions   Chaos-I vow on the chaos gods I shall not play it until I get the Blood &amp; Gore dlc, and then finally I will only play it on Legendary.  Beastmen-I will not be getting the Beastmen as there not a faction that interest me and $21 cad is a bit to high for me    Possible future factions  Chaos Dwarves-Lets be honest Dwarfs mixed with Chaos, I'm sorry please tell how thats not awesome, read some of the lore there cruel and love slavery (oh wait some people might get triggered) They actually build some crazy weapons look it up.  Skaven-There Rats and there Rats that kinda resemble a man, Oh course this is your chance to be that knight in shinning Armour to swoon that girl you fancy.  Tomb Kings Expedition-Think about it Settra leads a expedition into the old world can either be a advanced horde or occupy Ork cities and Dwarf Karaks    Battles&amp;Sieges  Earlier in this review I said 'Warhammer leans into medieval 2' that means less skill is needed to play the game as the main tactic I see is, Hammer and Anvil. With the loss of: Shield wall,Heavy, fire,normal arrows, etc, I find this to be less skillful and easier for newer players  Battles can take place out in the open or in cities, I have to say open battles are fun and exciting but Sieges are rather dissapointing and short with lack of planning to make a mighty last stand of the Dwarves against a horde of Orks but resorts to just put your troops on the walls and see who wins. (fix to sieges have a ♥♥♥♥ computer and battles will last hours even on triple speed )I would say the AI has improved but still prone to stupid decisions.     Replayability  With currently 6 factions (including dlc) there are many options for Replayability and with more to be added there is always hopefully something new    Running out of ideas so just read my very long and pointless sentence about my talking about how pointless it is   Now that this is over (guys don't worry I will update this )    Lead mighty armies of the Empire to victory! Capture lost Karaks and reclaim the lost honour of the Dwarves! Raise hundreds of long dead warriors to attack and become the rightful rulers of the Empire! Sound the battle horns of the beastmen and spread Chaos upon those that uphold law and order! Conquer the whole world as Archaon the Everchosen with the end times and countless Norscans and Daemons or you can just 'smash eads an crake skullz' with Grimgor Ironhide!        ",1,1,1
220240,Far Cry® 3,"I have not had the chance to finish this, but I would have to give it a mixed review. Overall, the gameplay is great. Everything looks wonderful and combat feels fun and challenging. A couple of things that break it for me are the endless repeated lines from the NPCs (I think they might only have one) and the really weird behaviors of the friendly AI.  One time I was walking along towards an objective, when suddenly a group of friendlies, which I did not even realise existed before this point, drove up and hopped out of the car (and all had identical character models. Creepy). I got in, drove a bit, and of corse managed to get the car stuck. I hopped out, tried to move it without luck, hopped back in without realising that the 'commandeer' option had popped up, and for some reason simply getting in the car caused everyone to shoot at me. A bit strange.  In any case, the game has been good. I would recomment it, and I have enjoyed it.",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"As far as I can tell, Planetside is a great game for teaming up with large groups of friends to take on enemies and work together in groups to make an experience where the skill of the individual is equally important as the teamwork between the players. This concept has been tried again, and again, but planetside offers a whole new look on this idea, with much, much larger servers to accomadate tons of players. This makes it more fun the play because your individual skrimishes seem more important and rewarding when the huge objective is completed.  That being said, I spent the first (and last) two hours of playing this game running around, not knowing what at all is going on. The two minute tutorials gave the player a general sense of how the average fps works without explaining the game at all. You are spawned into a giant hub where you press another button to be transported to who knows where, only to find yourself killed by some tank or aircraft camping your spawnpoint. After a few minutes, your team will do all of the work, causing you to either win or lose. Regardless, after that match is over, the whole thing will start all over again, throwing you into another viscious loop in which everyone blames you for being useless, (which of course, you are) but will not be willing to help you learn.  The mentoring system is a good step, but no game should force you look up help on the wiki or youtube videos just to be able to understand what is going on.  I am sure Planetside 2 is a great game, and I will keep playing for now, it looks like it may have quite a bit of potential, but I am sure that I am not the only one with such struggles. I can only assume that Planetside's poor introductory system is a insurmountable obstacle to people new to the game.  I am looking forward to understanding this game better so that I can write a more accurate and insightful reveiw.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 will steal your money. This is my latest review of the game. This review is not about the game itself, but the criminal enterprise runnning it. I had spent a lot of money after returning to the game after a few months of not playing. I upgraded my compendium. I was even starting to enjoy it again. Then I told my party 'BRB', as I left to get a cup of coffee. Someone in the party didn't see that, started the search, and I was unable to accept. So what would be a fair thing to do to someone who wasn't there to hit the initial accept button? If you guessed a 24 hour ban from all methods of earning 'points', I'm sure there's a lot of rational people out there who are sickened by that punishment. This compendium is a limited time deal, and now we're getting banned if we happen to not rady up BEFORE the game even starts. Takes about 2 minutes to search. Why would one deserve a 24 hour ban, after he just spent &gt;70$ on the game? This is by far the worst scam I've ever seen. Steam or anywhere, this is ridiculous. I'll be contacting the attorney genereral and I'm going to take every action I can to make sure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t isn't allowed to happen. Some people unfamiliar with the law think they have a 'ToS', which to them means a license to do whatever you want, because you can pull that, 'consult the ToS' card. This private contract is very very criminal in my opinion. Where is legislation to prevent Valve from continuing to steal my money? They have the right to lock my funds in my steam account 'for my own protection'. Takes 8 days for them to unlock it after a ticket. Now they just stole $70 from me. I never want to see or play this game again. I'll be cancelling payment immediately on my credit card.  I've never seen anything this ridiculous from ANY company. Blizzard, you need to hurry up with the HOTS. I understand now why people play league of legends. Scheme after scheme after scam after theft with Dota and Valve.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I joined PS2 way back. And I still play it today. So here is my review.   Pros: ~Large open world maps where you can fight up to over 200vs200 for a single point on one of the many maps.  ~Having such a large open world map means that there is pure freedom to how you fight. Not to mention the amount of weapons that are in the game can add an even more personal playstyle to your already custom playstyle.  ~Realistic flying space-ships that require skill to fly. (You feel like you're an actual pilot. This is my favorite part of this game)  ~Tons of ground vehicles such as: ATVs. Buggies. Tanks. Bigger tanks. And caravans.  ~The Developers are still going strong with this game; Adding stuff like new weapons, vehicles, bug-fixes, and help to those that need it.   ~Graphics are AMAZING.  Cons: ~Graphics are AMAZING, Which can be taxing on a PC, even at lowest settings. Especially in large scale battles where rockets, explosions, bullets, missiles, and tank shells are flying everywhere. This is the main cause to many of the FPS issues.  ~Due to the large scale of PS2, it can be hard for new players to get a grip of the game. But don’t worry; there are youtubers such as Wrel that are here to help!  ~The game can get repetitive after a while. I mean, all you do is fight one base, cap it, and move on to the next. Or if you’re on the losing side: Defend base, lose it, and move on to the next.  «------------------------»  All in all, this is one of the finest MMOFPS games out there.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"I enjoy Dota - what initially began as a way of connecting with my brother has evolved into a casual play when not conquering AoE/TW franchises or completing Skyrim for the fifth time - essentially, I continue to play Dota even after my brother defected to a second hand PS3. It's one of the very few multiplayer games I play after rage quitting RoTMG.   Here's the problem, I'm no good at Dota and after hours of gameplay, maybe I never will be. As previously mentioned, I dabble in a variety of games and like most, have a life outside fabricated worlds. I die often, fail to purchase 'necessary' gear, haven't learnt how to opperate a courier - nor do I feel then need to. The urge to win isn't strong enough to study Dota - win or lose, its been a good game if I've tried my hardest to support/carry victory. Understand I've won about half the amount of games played, half full.   I think most reading at this point are thinking - just GTFO. Its been the general response I've recieved during gameplay, and generally from team members. I can handle being called idiot and noob, even the rusty english some europeans hurl through their microphones - its harmless and almost pathetic, a laughable offense imo. I've even experienced games where team members will hang back when I've landed into danger/conflict with the enemy - and then be complained to about feeding stats, even if together we could have outweighed the opposition.  I've even been reported - its actually what spurred me to type this review, when I last logged onto Dota I was greeted with yet another drop down in priority. Admittedly, I quit the last game I was in prematurely just because I could be bothered with three angry european/american mix slinging abuse my way - instead I went to go make a sandwich. The agression this game brings out in some people makes Dota feel as if you're grinding through the majority of an hour, necessary back up replaced with heaps of swears.   Pro's  - Beautifal, intense, fast-paced gameplay. - Fantastic balance in characters &amp; roles.  - Responsive &amp; simple to control.  Con's  - A considerate amount of abuse if you're new to the game. - A considerate amount of reports if you're new to the game.  - The least helpful, most angry gamers in a server I've ever seen.  Do I recommend this game?   Yes - If you're a seasoned player  No - If you're just a beginner",-1,0,0

Ive got over 300 hours on dota and its still finding ways to keep me playing and it never gets boring for me.   I highly recommed Dota 2 for anyone who wants a new game to play and even if you already play league or smite you should still try out Dota because they are all good games and you get the best of all three. I play all three and im loving it.  Hope this helps anyone out with choosing Dota 2 as their new game of the week. Bye.",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,"This is a game which seems to require a considerable amount of time spent before it becomes remotely fun. You go through the tutorials and all is good.. you got this.  Join a game and all of a sudden you realise you have no idea what most of the heros actually do. You have no idea what any of the items do.. You realise that guy playing &lt;Insert OP Hero here&gt; is wooping your ♥♥♥ in the lane. You can't get any farm and you die... a lot. Better play a support, and just yknow support... all good playing your role well, warding what not. But this game is very dependant on teamwork... yet not many people have a microphone, some people don't say a word all game, 'Hey should we go for the kill, yo dude, antimage, should we do it? Hello'... then the dude jumps in and dies without warning and the rest of the game he yells at you (in text of course) for not following up with a stun. Then you lose and people blame you. My god the lack of fun had in this game is immense. Nobody has fun the losers are all butt-hurt they lost, and winners do nothing but yell each other all game.    If you like this kind of thing don't let my opinion stop you but if you don't play this thing, then just don't. Fun does not exist in this game.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is a breath of fresh air in an industry that seems to be stagnating; Chivalry: Medieval Warfare delivers the innovation and creative rebirth for us that have been craving something new.  Though not the first Melee Medieval FP game, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare takes from Mount and Blade: Warband and exands on it ten fold.  Pros:  -Addicting, fast-paced and intense gameplay and sword fights will have you losing track of time -Swordplay is heavily skill-based, and requires you to dodge, feign, overhead, stab, strafe, duck, and use directional swings, but for the love of god please watch your swings in a mosh pit.  -Weapons are incredibly satisfying to use, and both feel and are powerful.  -Well designed game-modes and objective based games let us experience the true potential of team based gameplay.  -Although built in the over-used Unreal Engine, the game still manages to look beautiful, from god-rays to the detailed armor and gore.  -Classes are relatively well-balanced overall.  -Map designs are varied, from sand enviornments to lush forests to keeps and castles and desecrated citidals.  Cons:  -Archers are still OP. (Look into your heart, you know this to be true)  -The balance and fairness of some weapons remain up for debate.  -Teammates do not know how to use overheads and stabs and will likely decapitate you in a mosh pit.  -Server browser is slow and a painful experience to work with; joining friends could be easier.  The game is great. Playing with a buddy is massive fun. But for your own sake, please do the tutorial and ALWAYS go into teamfights with the assumption that your teammates have no idea what they're doing, because they WILL get you killed, especially since this game does go on free-to-play weekends pretty often.

570,Dota 2,"Put simply, there much better MOBA's out there. The characters are boring and one-dimensional save a few (Broodmother and Sven are really the only interesting ones.) The game is just a glorified shadow on Defense of the Ancients.  While many praise it's unique factors, it does nothing to set itself apart from any other MOBA. There are plenty of FTP MOBA's out there, and seeing another top-down, barebones, and somewhat fustratingly repressive scenario is getting old.  As for laning, it's boring as hell when compared to other games like SMITE, League of Legends, and HotS. Unlike most other MOBA's, you are very restricted in your spell usage. Even something as simple as regenerating yourself for 30% of your HP costs upwards to 60% of your mana, and it DOES NOT come back quickly. Expect to spend the first 15 minutes of the game right clicking on uninspired minions that look like reject sprites from Warcraft 3...oh wait. They kind of are, in a way.  So with these oppressive mana costs, don't expect high-action, blood-pumping team-fights you come to expect from the genre... especially when 75% of the teamfight is spent with loss-of-control conditions like 4 second AoE stuns, constantly reapplied 70% movement speed slows, and 2.5 second snares on a 6 second cooldown. You know what makes a video game fun? Being able to play it.  For what the game does do well... not much. I do have to hand it to the guys at Valve, though. I like the Hats. Unlike other FTP MOBA's that generate revenue from entire skins that cost $10 a pop, you can customize your favourite Hero with all kinds of small do-dats that are virtually costless... in fact, many of them are rewards obtained for just playing the game regularily. Instead of Valve saying 'Hey kids, buy this recouled version of your favourite Skeleton King, only $10.00!' they instead say 'Here's a bunch of creative apparel; let the 8 year old girl in her grandmothers attic inside of you run wild! Oh, that'll be $0.35 by the way.' If I want to give my Spider Queen a top hat and monocle, they have an item for that; it's like the app store - you want it, they have it for less than $5.00.  My biggest complaint about the game... is the HUD. Enough is enough. I HAVE HAD IT WITH THIS GOD DAMN HUD ON MY GOD DAMN SCREEN! It's constantly getting in your way when you want to move around or scroll through the map (which is literally just 2 colours - green on one side and black the other. It's a VERY dull scene with little to no attention to detail.) In any other top-down MOBA, they did what the obvious step was - get the HUD out of the way. However in DotA 2, they instead decided that the HUD should take up 2/5 of the screen, and have as many buttons tthat could be accidently pressed when going toe-to-toe with the enemy, ruining your combo by putting a gigantic block in between you and the action saying 'This is your Hero's stats. I'm sure this is relevant to you right now, seeing as every millisecond in this genre could mean life or death.'  Over-all, the game is very lackluster when compared to other MOBA's, in some shape or form. If you are looking for a MOBA with beginner-friendly mechanics or a balanced playing field, try League of Legends. If you want to fell like a badass tearing your foes limb-for-limb with a great community and more skill-based system, try SMITE. If you are looking for a nostalgia bonor, play HotS. There is literally nothing in this game that other MOBA's can't offer you a better deal on other than customization.  Final Verdict: 7/10 in general, 3.5/10 by MOBA standards.",-1,0,0

I have been avoiding Ubisoft games because of this.   The next is the overly long cut scenes and the arbitrary button mashing boss fights. If you have trouble with them there is no way to get around them. Frustrating is the nicest way to put it.  I have played Far Cry 1 and 2 and I have found all of the series to be flawed gems. There is something in all the games that was nonsensical and frustrating. In Far Cry 2 is was the spamming patrol stations. In Far Cry 3 it is the frustrating knife fights.

Unless you are aiming to become a click master, that practises on clicking faster each time and genuinly tries to improve their clicking skills, this has no game elements what so ever. It requires hardly any thought or skills. Has no real purpose. No goals, no targets, nothing... After a while even the clicking becomes useless as it will be such a minor part of progress, you might as well just stare at the screen.  Addictive though.. Even while doing nothing you get 'presents' and achievements.As you get money while offline, you easilly want to go back just to 'check how much I have accumulated by now' and BAM!   You want to stare at a game while doing nothing, go check out something on Twitch or so. At least then you might encounter a fun streamer.

265930,Goat Simulator,"Goat Simulator is a joke of a game. You take control of a goat in a small town with absurd physics. A simple headbutt from the goat will blow up a car.

Goat Simulator is small, deliberately unpolished and buggy and its design is simple. But it is a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I had previously written a positive review with strong caveats but am changing it to negative. At this point I feel that the bugs and the developers' ignoring of said bugs (especially after the release of the DLC) have too much of a negative impact on the game to enjoy anymore.  The game from a design standpoint is fantastic. They made the best melee combat system I've seen in a game and there's a good variety of maps and game modes to play around with. The style of the game with lots of gratuitous severing of limbs and decapitations and the ridiculous warcries gives it a nice over-the-top feel that make it a lot of fun.  Unfortunately there are many bugs, some of which completely destroy any concept of class and weapon balance, that have existed since release. The developers flat out refuse to acknowledge that these bugs even exist, much less fix them. They have shown themselves to be completely clueless about weapon balance as well, often buffing the stronger weapons in patches and nerfing the weaker ones. From what I understand the situation has only gotten worse since the release of the DLC. Every server is pretty much guaranteed to have several people exploiting these bugs and ruining it for everybody else.

218230,PlanetSide 2," Massive eternal war.    Presentation:  7 The game was released in 2012 so the graphics are not as good as it would be if it was released today, but because it was PC exclusive back then the graphics have aged well and are still quite good. The audio was fairly good to begin with and has been updated several times to be even better. Each faction has unique designs for their soldiers, weapons and vehicles. Each continent has a unique climate and look.   Gameplay:  7 It's a class/loadout based shooter like battlefield with land and air vehicles. It also now features resource gathering and base building. Battles are not usually determined by individual skill, but by the amount of players and the equipment available to the players. Battles can contain hundreds of players.   Story:  5 The different factions don't like one another because of political differences. It's a multiplayer only game without characters, so players are left to create their own stories.   Total:  6.7/10",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Tl;Dr - If you're looking for a quick fix for your Total War itch, don't bother here. If you really dig the fantasy setting or already own the previous Total War installments, get Warhammer at a 50% discount minimum. This should have been an expansion back for Attila (price point-wise).  I know I'll get a lot of flack for not liking this iteration of Warhammer come to life in an RTS game, but frankly, it's not the idea of Warhammer I don't like, it's the implementation. Essentially I was pleasantly surprised to see CA go after the Warhammer franchise. A franchise that combines fantasy and the joy of medieval combat sounds like a dream come true, right? Unfortunately, the result is far from the truth.  Quite frankly, this game is a dissapointment on so many levels for me. While you can still get enjoyment out of it, especially if you are a hardcore Warhammer fan, that does not make up for the sheer lack of overall effort that shows everytime you boot a game up. But enough of that, let's get started with the usual list!  Pros:  1. The graphics - The game looks good...I mean...REALLY good. It has plenty of visual flair and charm despite my growing distate for the game as a whole.  2. Leaders - For the most part each leader adds a new and interesting mechanic to your battles, a nice change of pace from the political setups from Rome 2 and Attila.  3. Siege and Regular Battles - Regular battles have different visual styles that vary based on location, whilst sieges can certainly look gorgeous they also have MAJOR cons that we'll get to shortly.  4. No Politics/children - This one just speaks for itself.  And now, the Cons:  1. Complete lack of quanitity - So, remember when I made the jab at Atilla with 'Attila Lite' in my last review? Yeah, Warhammer is even worse, which you would almost think to be impossible. Now I get that there are only so many races, but dear gods, one faction per race? Seriously? And people try to justify that? Basically if you want to play coop with someone you cannot be the same race despite there being multiple factions per race. You also cannot play a different faction after you've grown tired of playing the exact same starting position with the exact same enemies around you. And no, different lords do not add enough variety to change that.  2. Great Power Debuff - This one just speaks for itself.  3. Agents - It was a pretty cool idea to have 'heroes' that you can use to bolster your army, such as using a Dwarven Engineer to increase the stats and reload speed of your artillery. Each hero has unique abilities for each race and you could really benefit from them in battle....oh...you say that the AI will only use them like agents from the previous Total War games and eventually you'll be dealing with the six or so agents from all your enemies that are completely unstoppable just like Attila? Well that was a waste of time.  4. Enemy Units Routing...Psych! - Yeah, this is probably the worst and most unrealistic part of Warhammer, a univese with gryphons (griffons?) and dragons. Picture this, you're in a close battle with the enemy lord, your troops have flanked his best warriors and you've decimated the enemy archers and horseman. Now all that's left is to bring this battle to a clo-....wait....why are my Hammerers dropping like flies? *glance around map for hidden units* Why the hell is that archer unit of only 10-20 men back in battle? ♥♥♥♥♥! How did that horseman unit of 15 come back and flank my warriors?! Yeah, get ready for this constantly happening. It's annoying and drags out battles for far too long. You'll constantly find weak units coming back. My advice? Don't even bother playing the dwarves if that annoys you. The Slayers are the only thing you'll have that can run down those units to make sure they don't come back.  5. Settlements/Cities - Wow do these look half-♥♥♥♥♥, just from the in-game ui alone. Do you remember Yu-Gi-Oh? How about Pegusus' Toon world? Yeah. That's pretty much what every city looks like from the grand campaign...toon towns.  6. Siege Battles - And now for the largest let down of all. I'm sure you've already heard of this, but siege battles suck. About 1/4 of the city is available to you, limiting your encirclment options to a head-on charge, Units pull ladders out of their hidden bags of holding, lodged somewhere securely in their rears, and when you get on the enemy walls? Yeah, your units get down by clipping through the battlements...Such a showcase of effort and time right there. But the worst part? The cities actually look really good, especially the background art. All of which just makes you wish for an actual siege battle like the previous games.  7. Siege Battles Continued - Settlements don't have siege battles unless you've builts walls. What does that mean? It means no more using choke points to your advantage on low level settlements, instead you get to fight on a generic battle map. I guess those budget cuts even hit your engineers.  At the end of the day, the best I can say about Warhammer is that it looks pretty. That it has potential. But sadly there's very little effort and quality here, especially when compared to previous Total War entries (Attila included). The lack of faction choices within each race is a sour taste every time you start a new game, especially so if you plan to play coop. Creatively, Warhammer is a step in the right direction for CA, but from a mechanic and quality standpoint it's miles behind Shogun 2.  9/25 Edit - Spell check",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is probably my favorite Total War game to date! Medieval II will always have a special place in my heart, since it was my first Total War, but I can honestly say I can foresee myself getting just as much if not  more  time and fun out of Total War: WARHAMMER. Especially if those two expansions work out, as I am positive they will. As a life-long fan of Warhammer Fantasy, but having never really been able to get into the hobby, this combination of games is something I've been dreaming about for a long time.  Each of the four factions are fantastically diverse, both on and off the field! The Dwarfs keep their book of grudges, the Greenskins build their Waaagh!, the Empire with their politics, and the Vampire Counts who can raise new armies from the dead!  The battles look phenomenal, the units are really well-done. The magic system is fantastic too, lots of fun and really looks great sweeping across the enemy lines!  The battle maps are all gorgeous too, absolutely stunning. Plenty of terrain diversity, and sometimes obstacles to fight around!  At the time of writing this, I also own the Chaos and Beastmen DLCs, and I have to say this game is worth every penny I've put into it so far. I normally don't write too many reviews, as I'm sure you can tell by the quality of this one, but the rating this game is getting on Steam is just plain unfair to it.",1,0,1

I recommend using the Recursion Tracker for increased encouragement (and/or discouragement from deaths) by listening to Radlock taunt in the guise of the old Unreal Tournament announcer.  I'm not a vehicle guy, but the infantry combat is addictive beyond belief. It may seem impossible to fight back against vehicles as anything but a Heavy Infantry or MAX, but there's a reason for that: other vehicles! Air is the answer to all opposition. With enough air support an entire base can be captured with minimal infantry.  The level of immersion and tactics possible make me keep coming back. It helps to be able to pay full attention and really immerse yourself in the voice chat and squad play. Solo has its moments, but the real enjoyment comes from contributing to your squad and helping your faction capture the point from your sworn enemies.  Finally, I implore you to pledge your allegience to a single faction. Those loyal to their empire such as myself feel an intense pride when capturing points due to this cooperation and sense of camaraderie we get with our fellow soldiers as we throw our cloned selves back into the fray to claim ground even if just for a short while.",1,0,1

The game is beautiful, feels great, plays great, sounds great, but lacks a large amount of challenge. Most of the sections of the game which didn't just throw you into the action are all able to be completed with stealth. You're even rewarded extra experince for being stealthy, so it's not like the game isn't encouraging it. But when the action picks up, its still pretty easy. Headshots aren't difficult to pull off, plus you're practically invincible, all you have to do is keep pulling that bullet out of your left arm and snapping your finger back into place and you'll be A okay. The AI isn't briliant, the enemy will just be trained on your position and move forward, nothing complex coming from them. Plus your skills encourage easy mode, like the takedown ability. Next thing you know your knife is the primary weapon. The story is interesting and goes places, some of the characters are alright, some are great but they don't all come together in a good way to really make the story. The whole idea of the game is based around you saving all your friends and thats all but a fragment of what the game wants to tell you instead. It's a bit jarring to go back to the little cave you're hidding you're friends in because it really chops the game up. Far Cry 3 is worth playing at a cheap price, because it is a fantastic open world game, just don't expect much of a challenge at all.",1,1,1

265930,Goat Simulator,"What is Goat Simulator?  Recently there has been a lot of hype revovling around this game for its randomness and such, but is it really worth it to buy and play? Better question, will this game last you a long time, or at least long enough to get maybe a decent amount of hours in before your sick of it? For I regretably found the creul truth of this game, it's just not enough fun. There isn't nearly enough fun, wacky things to do as a goat in this game to keep you occupied. Of course, just as I did, you'll have an hour or so when you'll say something like'BEST GAME EVER!', later you'll find out it's more of a in the moment feeling. I did have a good hour or so when it felt like it was so much fun, not knowing what to screw up as a goat next, but then very soon it was evident, the game got boring. (THE GAME LIVES OFF THE FACT OF YOU BEING A GOAT TOO MUCH!!!)  What do you do in the game?  The game consists of you, a goat, being well, a goat. You basically terrorize a small(and I mean SMALL) town and do what ever you really feel like whether it's ruin a family's dinner or grab a big boulder with your tounge and hurt stuff(kind of fun). Your main things you can do are move around with the W,A,S,D keys(duh), run with the shift key, use the E key to grab to stuff with your tounge and take it somewhere(maybe out for dinner?) and of course jump with the SPACE BAR. Also as you do more things in the game more small abilities unlock like the GOATBORN, which is basically you being able to Fus Ro Da as a goat, which I admit, can be fun.  Should I Buy This Game?  Really I don't know if I can tell you the answer completly, but I may be able to push a little towards my idea of the situation. This game is is fun for only how long you let it be fun. By that I mean it's fun only if you sort of have an imagination or like just messing around with no real incentives, or goals. Personally, when I play a game I feel I need some sort of goal to push towards and acheive because well that's sort of what makes a lot of games fun. Now there are a few small 'goals' you can do, but nothing really worth going into depth like doing a backflip, but earning nothing in return, horay. So if you want to spend 10$ on this game go ahead, just remember, the game in a nutshell dosen't have much substance to it so it won't last long if you don't like just messing around.  NOTE: Also just like to note that there isn't any multiplayer, but there is a workshop kind of thing where you can doownload other people's maps, which could grant a few more hours of play.   VERDICT: 7/10 It's Ok  Pro Your a goat Gives you a good laugh Only 10$(Could also be a con couldn't though?)

The gore is simply hilarious and makes for a good time even if you are the one who is gettin cut to pieces. Idk what other reviews mean when they are talking about the game having a douchey community filled with team killers. I havent expierenced anything like that.

Dota 2 is a great game like i said but for newcomers its very very very hard to get into it. The reason for this is because the community in Dota can be very toxic. You dont know if you go into a game and find a bratty player that will only do the things that he wants and if he doesnt then he ruins the game for you. Id recommend that if you're getting into dota, play several bot matchs and change the difficulty to challenge yourself and then once you have over come that step go to the online bot matchs and meet newcomers and work on your team capapility skills and further on. Later after you get the logistics of the game youll want to head to the public mattch making and play there. Note: At least have 10 heros that you can play and be able to play different roles. After quite some time in the public matchmaking id recommend playing ranked matchmaking and test yourself to see if youre strong enough for the pros.",1,0,1

The Items that you can buy does not make you better in the game. it is just a skin for your weapon / armor. But still it is rediclues that you have to pay 7 euro in a payed game for a fancy item. The game itself is really good very good balanced and realy fun to play... If you can play. because i experiance crashes all week. And so i cant play this game anymore.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"When I first started this game, I was struck by it's immediate warning, which had the words 'light', 'loud' and 'scare' - already that sounded like the kind of passive agressive / insane temperament I was forced to grow up with as a child in Long Island, NY in the 1980's.   After many hours being in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, I can say this place is one that you owe yourself, as a human being who uses a computer, watches films, and likes a good story - to vist at least once.  I appreciate the source of emotion this game uses - the fear of inanimate objects being imbued with life - the sadness of tainted childhood (let alone - LOST childhood...) - the anger at an unappreciate employer (you have NO idea what I have been through...!) - the joy of victory...that last one will only last briefly.   The plot is that you are a night watchman at a nearly defunct children's party place, akin to a Chucky Cheese, which was the source of video games/arcades in the 1980's and is what helped even spawn the popularity of games today (this game, in essence - is a twisted homage to the very origin of mainstream gaming). The game was 'sold' to me that you were making sure the puppets do not move, and do not come to your room. I was very confused - to me this game looked HORRIFYING but there was no hint at the horror, and it felt more like a 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space' mixed with 'Child's Play' type of experience...why are all these screenshots so scary, yet the gameplay sounding so innocent?  Because the game itself relies on your fear: of the strange, of adults, and of corruption.  The things I love most about this game are unfortunately, what I feel most big budget developers, and most gamers now, would and will try to change. I see 'complaints' about Five Nights At Freddy's, but to me, are it's sordid virtues:  - The game cannot be played in windowed mode (which means..no distractions! - when you play, you are immersed in the game as if you were playing it on a TV/Console or Arcade - you can't multitask, typing in Word, ordering crap on Amazon, changing songs in iTunes, check your Wordpress, Facebook, Farm, etc. etc.)  - The game can't change resolution or 'insert setting here' (because the developer perfected it for you - this game is an artfully created experience - it's like a video game version of a French Film from the 60's - it's an 'auteur' at work - the game's creator knows what he is doing, trust him - and go with the sound settings and graphics he picked - let the 'Five Nights At Freddy's' take you as its prisoner.....in every way...)  - There is no save setting (The beauty of this game is that an enjoyable play session can go anywhere from 2-20 minutes - and the learning curve is steep - save settings and short levels become redundant)  This game is worth every penny of it's price. I purchased it based on it's uniqueness and that it spoke to me as a lover of a good story well told. I was rewarded with an amazingly crafted and simple Puzzle Horror game that I could play at day or night - and within seconds be swept away to an intense little cramped office, where all that mattered was immediate survival - 'Five Nights At Freddy's' is not just about watching cute animatronic characters in a security camera - it's about why you're watching them - are we as 'dumb' as the person who took this job? Maybe he just wanted a scare and a challenge too.  Play it, enjoy it - take your time - then go watch a horror film and play a game - 'Five Nights At Freddy's' is an ode to both.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I'm changing my review,Planetside 2 as of recent gotten alot worse,And it's sad this being my favorite game to play with friends,It had alot of potential but if it can't be fixed this is it's funeral,I recently got a new PC to run my games better and when downloading Planetside 2 SOE locked me out of my account I lost roughly 50$ in cosmetic gear and vehicle weapons.This is sad the game has gone downhill by alot and the PS4 port for it was cancelled, SOE has run this game into the ground at it's peak and it's sad because each new update adds more and more issues to the game then fixed,They think by adding more content people will look the other way about issues, but they are not.As for Planetside 2 I give it an 8/10 same as my last review but cannot recommend the game in the state it's in,I don't doubt by the time the next update comes out if there are no fixes it will be the last nail in this game's coffin",-1,0,0
220240,Far Cry® 3,"I wish there was an 'Okay' button because this game would have deserved that place. But since there isn't I'm going to have to rate this up. The thing is with this game is that it's too short. I did everything (aside from those Ubisoft races) in about 24 hours. The story is great but the ending was meh and the gameplay feels amazing and the graphics are great. But as well with other Ubisoft games, they have great content but it's short and not too many. You can liberate Outposts and (hack?) Towers so you can have view on that part of the Island on your map. But here's the catch, there's only 34 Outposts. It may seem a lot to you when you first start playing but when you get farther into the game it's not that much. Once you finish the storyline and do all the Outposts and Towers you're done with the game. All you can basically do is explore the island once you are done, which is nice but it gets boring after awhile. Multiplayer is dead so don't even try finding one. Buy this when it's on sale because it's worth the $30 (it's the price of the game at this time of review) but at the same time it doesn't. I just wish this game was filled with Outposts like 50 or 100 but that would get too repetitive but atleast it would give you something to do. This game has about 22 hours in total of things to do but in all honesty, just buy it when it's on sale. Great game just too short.",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"It's better than Fallout New Vegas, and it's better than the Elder Scrolls games. Don't let the Steam game time fool you. I originally started playing on X360 when I was 16, maybe 17. I've also played a lot through a script extender, and I'm not sure if it keeps track of those hours since I wasn't able to access Steam Overlay. I've probably put over 500 hours into this game. I've collected so many clothing items, building items, weaponry, and random collectibles in this game for the sole purpose of hording it all and having more options. I would be willing to bet I had every single melee and every ranged weapon in the game, and just about every clothing item if not all of them. I visited EVERY SINGLE location on the map, even all the metro tunnels including all their nook and crannys. Hell I'd even visited just about, if not all of the indoor areas, so I downloaded mods for new areas with interesting twists. The urge to explore and collect everything in the capital wasteland is so high. every hidden back story must be known. But there I was, I'd collected about everything and seen and done about everything. So what did I do? I installed more mods to make the game more difficult, to make me feel like more a of survivor of the wastes. I can't even begin to describe how difficult it had been at times, but it was important to me to make it more realistic after I'd had a chance to complete everything. This game can be a collector and explorers dream. And it can also be a gritty, dark, and difficult survival game. If it weren't for the fact that I've simply run out of things to do besides replay everything I've already done (of which, I've restated this game innumerable times), I'd probably still be playing this game all the time.  This game is crack.",1,0,1

It's fun to 100% the story and it's fun to mess around coop with friends.   If you are looking at the negative reviews, just like I did, you will just find peapole complaining about uPlay and not having a code for the game (Wich you just have to write down from your steam library under Far Cry 3) But now uPlay is not havving issues with anything, you can play the game, save files don't dissapear and Coop works.  This game is a must buy for everyone who likes a good story, guns and stuff to do outside the story (In singleplayer).",1,0,1

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"This is not a game for Those Horror fans that like to feel like they can avoid the danger if they are smart enough.   Welcome to Freddy's Fazbear's Pizza, where 4killer animatronic Robots want you dead every moment of every night during your entire shift.  This game does well in what it aimed to do, cause the player feel helpless, and scared, and having them endure each level on the skin of thier teeth. For normal fans of horror, this game probably is not a good fit, unless you enjoy feeling helpless and like the game is short changing your resources. This game comes down to Understanding the pattern of the Four Robots, knowing how to prevent an attack, managing your resource of limited, unrechargable energy, and a quick ear, and luck.  This game also offers a very extensive lore, that is revel only enough to make the player feel like there's some sort of story, but not giving the full picture, cause many fans to theorize what the story is based on in game clues. This is also a negative point though, since the fanbase is childish, most theroies are half baked, and is overall annoying.  7/10 New good concept good execution good feels controls good  not for the typical Horror fan Based more on luck than skill in highest difficulty awful fanbase",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"So i yet to complete the game so i can't talk much about it.  Here is what i like.  Great graphics, yea the game looks really good, even tho the enemies do need more variety and the landscape may get bored to look at after 10 plus hours. The main missions are very good. Lots of things to do. Ecology and unpredictable creatures make the world come alive. Role-playing elements and difficulty curve make u play more than once. Good multiplayer for this type of game. Lots of weapons and ways to enjoy combat.  Here is what i don't like about the game.  Easy money, yea u get money so fast in this game that just 5 hours into the game u have money to buy the best weapons, money u don't really need since the game gives weapons for FREE. Generic side quests. One word, BORING... Enemy AI is laughable sometimes. Stealth is also not that well implemented which might lead to minor frustrations. Spawns and spawn rates are stupid. Kill all enemies in the area?, wait too long others will spawn and u have to do it all over again. Gunplay is not that good. U will notice this, if u play other FPS games like BF or COD. The wildlife is way too overpower, takes for EVER to kill animals. The main hero who is over sensitive to drops (you could literaly kill yourself by jumping from 3m height!) Also the game may get bored too soon if u get all weapons and done all the crafting upgrades.  So, overall Far Cry 3 is a good game, but one that has a lot of things to work before it becomes great. There r just too many flaws for me personally to completely enjoy it, but enough to recommend to people that might like this type of games.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 is FREE. It's FREE and it's pretty good quality for such a FREE game. It's hard to complain about when the game is FREE, but the game is actually a little difficult to jump into right away. There is a bit of a learning curve and it can be kind of frustrating sometimes. However, once you get a grasp on the concept of how the game works and what you need to do or where to go then it can be quite enjoyable from time to time. The gameplay itself is best decribed as a mix between Battlefield 1942 and the original Tribes but on a much more massive scale. You've got hundreds of people fighting on the same continent so if you have a weaker PC, it might get choppy. The graphics are really nice. Very impressive for a free to play game. I really wish there was a way to win a game. There is no end to it, unfortunately. It's just constant battle you're trying to control points around the world for your faction.

No. This game is 'stupid' in that there isn't a story behind it at all. To be honest, this actually may end up sparking your imagination to the point you make up a story. Why is this goat going on a rampage? Why is it made of a living indestructible alloy? And just why is everyone named in such weird ways?  It's hard to explain how the controls feel, just that they feel right. Your goat does do silly things at times despite your objections, but don't be afraid to smile.  Bugs? Oh, they exist. But many of them are so-called 'good bugs' and seeing the world go insane because you attained the correct procedure to do so and you can be in tears. As of this writing, I have yet to experience a bug that has killed my amusement.  Honestly, for the amount of money you'll pay for it, I think it's definitely worth it.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I dont play (ok, played) this on my PC but on my Tablet.. I thought I write my warning here..  The game is a time waster.. very good one.. and became with the last update even MORE time waster. Let me explain. The game is a resource game.. running in real time. You can play it clicking your ♥♥♥ off, play it idle and do nothing at all beside a few clicks every here and then.. or a mix of both.  I played a mix, as sometimes I want to click a bit and other times I prefer to sleep! :p So for 5 days I wasted my time.. and I felt very sorry for myself during game time.. why am I wasting my life with this? Anyhow.. got myself a little setup and reached Lv400 in 50min on my farm run for hero souls. Got about 350 on average on a run. Skilled mainly chance to spawn a Primal Boss and Hero Souls drop amount plus more gold in IDLE mode. I was happy wasting my time... and the update came.. no question, do you want to upgrade? Just suddenly I got way more Hero Souls.. niiiice, what a lucky run.. when I hit over 1k Souls.. I started to understand, something goes different as usual. Bed time.. started game again next day and screen pops up.. Transcence bla bla.. Help Screen to explain it all.. like a lerner driver gets this instruction: Open Door of the car, start car, drive as it is demanded by law, park and exit car. So.. basicly nada! Next I start my run.. why are my heroes not guilded anymore?? Why does all take soooooooo much longer? To make it short.. that is what r2games sold you. We made a upgrade and BALANCED the game. How unbalanced it was before.. example: My next upgrade for chance to get a primal boss was 72 Hero Souls... after the update +86k Hero souls.. so the developper thought it needed a balance to a skill that was 1 : 1200 out of balance. Yes, but we gave you more Hero Soul income too... true.. went from 400 average to 1500 on a run.. lets say 4 time more... to 1200 more cost.. my same farm run of 50min is now over 3 hours... and instead of beeing able to upgrade my chance for hero boss 3 times on one farm run to 400.. I would need over 50 runs for 1 upgrade. So wasting time is one thing, this is just simply super stupid.. I guess to many people came to the end of 'get arthritis when you are old game'.. and instead of putting some brain into it.. they just made everything a s h i t l o a d take more time.  So all in short: If you want to kill your last brain cells with boredom, if you cant understand or play games, which demands at least an IQ of 90.. this is your game and you will LOVE it!!! In any other case.. do yourself a favor, man... drill yourself a hole in your head.. makes more sense than playing this game for brain dead idiots. This is THE game for street cleaners, garbage men and bums living under the bridge.. about the IQ you need to play this junk and think this is a great game..",-1,0,0

By the time after this long after release, I should have more than 36 hours played.   CA and SEGA has lost all faith. I will not buy another game from them .",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I haven't played Total War games before and when i heard about the Warhammer based game i desided to give it a try. Unfortunately the game is built around experienced players only.   The tutorial contains 2 videos that explain how the controlls work in the battle, nothing about how you actually should use your units. The in game tutorial is a very easy battle that you really don't have to do anything to win. while in game you suddenly discover heroes that cannot be killed by regular armies but can assasinate your general or block your path every turn making your life miserable. nothing of this even mentioned in the 'tutorial'. not to mention the computer almost always manages to get almost 2 times as much soldiers as i have at the location despite me having max army cap on the hero and all that on 'normal' difficulty. if you are new to this series prepare to dig into the guides and streams or youtube videos becose thats how you learn to play this game, really dissapointing...  Edit: after some learning(?!): 1) the game feels very linear in the research trees and building trees. very little meaningfull choise to make there and some technologies are just overal better than the alternatives. 2) one resource economy, rare resources are available but depending on your race you may not have any allies to trade them with at all. you can manage economy by just building a few income buildings in your provinces and not recruiting unneeded armies. very simple. 3) agents - the game is about agents not armies, they can assasinate enemy heroes and leader, kill their armies, prevent them from moving, and all that without even declaring war on them. to top it out they can only be killed by other agents so you must have leveled agents or when the computer brings his agents you will be helpless against them. watching how they murder your army.  verdict, very weak and boring for strategy lovers. if you are looking for a nice strategy to force you to think and customize your empire keep looking nothing for you here. if you like the series, warhammer lore and or simplified strategies you might want to check this out.",-1,1,0

While they left out a few units in each army (ex flagellants for empire) they did a good job animating the units they did include. The flying in the game is a unique touch that augments the game. The only downside is the AI. When you play single player the AI tends to run hordes of the same units there is little to no variety.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Beautiful visuals, clever AI, outstanding vehicles and a glitch-free single player campaign top the list of strengths on this latest tropical-island-of-death title. Players would be well-advised to stop and smell the roses (and maybe craft them into a syringe) in Far Cry 3, however, to avoid the occasional feeling of repetitive gameplay and an obnoxiously drawn out finale in the story mode.   Multiplayer maps are large and mostly well designed but such efforts are too often undermined by underpopulated matches and poor matchmaking that results in disconnections and game crashes.  If you don't already own a title in this well reviewed franchise, Far Cry 3 won't be a regrettable purchase if you grab it on sale and can stomach the anguish of Ubisoft's 'uPlay' DRM and the limited multiplayer possibilities.  STEAM IN-HOME STREAMING RATING: Acceptable. uPlay DRM game launching headaches and some artifacting issues with occasional framerate drops.",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Well, Here's what I have to say about Warhammer Total War (TL;DR at the bottom)  First off, one of the best Warhammer games ever made (I still really miss Horned Rat though). As CA's first forray into this universe, I have to say, despite some minor details left to be desired, I had a lot of fun, and I will still have a lot of fun as I try new things and engage more with the different races. I see the potential this IP has, and I want to encourage CA to continue making this experience more vibrant and more in depth. As new races come out and as new features are added, I think this will be one of their best games.  On the tech side, this is one of the smoothest experiences I have ever had when dealing with a Total War game which made me almost cry in joy. On a campaign side... ehhh... They took a few steps back from the normal series, but considering this is the first stab, I can forgive some things. As new installments come out, I will be pretty picky for improvements and MOAR LORE haha.   Quest battles were fun! I just wish that they went a little more in depth with the characters, scripts, and events in game. Most of the time, when Chaos came, I merely shrugged my shoulders and sent my finest armies to meet Archaon head on and nipped him in the bud... So, on that note, more lore, more quests, more story, but overall? It satiated my bloodlust for dead orcs, vampires (ha!), Empire secessionists, stunties, and chaos scoundrels. I did play as all the races except for Dwarves. I'm getting to them, but I really wanted to get my demigryph fix in first haha. I had a great time as all of them, and might I recommend Blood for the Blood God DLC - while I feel like it should be in the base game, It makes everything soooooooooo much more rewarding.  The mechanics are fun, and I appreciate the detail to each race. That was well done where each race had distinct advantages and disadvantages. So, it did NOT feel like Attila in that department.   While the DLC policy annoys me, the developer did make a great base game. The DLC? I'll just wait patiently for a sale and get them all when it's time. the FreeLC is awesome, and it comes to me as a well appreciated little bonus considering they really don't have to do jack for us. The updates and support also meets above satisfaction, so I really can't complain too much.  If we think of this as a first step to something better, then it explains a lot. As a Total War game, it regressed a lot in mechanics, but it also really fine tuned a lot of problems I experienced in other titles in combat, balance, diplomacy, trade, raiding, and conquering. I personally love that I don't have to take over the entire map. I mostly wnated to leave barren wastes in my wake, and I did. It was epic. The really cool thing is that they didn't always stay barren for long! New races and people moved in, and it made the world soooo much more realistic and fun! I had to constantly change strategies because a new race popped up and suddenly decided to live in the barren wasteland near my border.   Considering it's their first stab at the Warhammer universe, and let's face it... most Warhammer games are half ♥♥♥♥♥ and barely playable... the fact that I can sit down and play a Warhammer game that's pretty entertaining, well detailed (JESUS THAT WORLD MAP IS PRETTY), and has a lot of really fun stuff to do and accomplish, I mean... seriously. I'm just glad it finally happened. I'm having a good time.   If you don't like the price, wait for it to go down during the Winter Sale - I don't regret a single penny (unlike Attila).  So, TL/DR: great Warhammer game (FINALLY); Not too shabby Total War Game (regressed in mechanics and gameplay, but still fun and solid). Don't like the price of base game or DLC? No problem, just wait for the Winter Sale - won't kill ya.",1,0,1

Every Hero is meant to be 'overpowered' yet half the bloody Hero Selection is never chosen because the same easy2win Heroes are picked every time.   Every other champion has a stun or some form of disruption, and failing that they have way too much damage. Better still, many of easy2win champions have a stun/disruption AND twice as much damage as you.  Don't think the game is really technical with all it mechanics, you'll go up against the same Heroes that are barely skillful in their own mechanics, and tend to bolster this stupidity with the most stupid ideas for items. Items can give your high damage, long ranged carry an easy escape with invisibility. Need to shred the armor of the enemy? Sure there is an item for that too! Stun? Yep. Evasion? Oh yes.

One issue I find frustrating is the way enemy Hero will route when 1v1ing your Hero. Watching your hero try and chase down their fleeing opponent is anti-climactic, especially when it's a big Orc boss. I would prefer they fought to the death. I not a fan of how enemy Heroes can be re-recruited after you kill them. It was disheartening to finally kill Grimgor, only to have him respawn later on.  I would also like battles to be a little bloodier, it would make them feel heavier and speak to the violence that Warhammer is associated with.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I feel compelled to wright a review of this because this SHOULD be a good game.  The concept and play style of this game are great. The objective matches are fun, ffa is a blast, and team deathmatch is excellent. However you will quickly get over the fun of cleaving heads and arms from bodies when you try to improve your skills. Thats where things get frustrating.  There is some skill required to time your stikes and parrys correctly and that is an excellent dynamic, however, it all really comes down to your ping, and your enemies ping in the end. You will freqiently see your arrows pass through others, blows that land, but dont, and you'll be beheaded by enemies that are not even swinging their weapons. The differences between how you perceive your moves and how the sprites perform are sluggish as best. This makes the combat clunky and hard to use, and you find quickly that there are a few weapons and classes that make buttonmashing an easy way to accidentally kill others.  Don't buy this game, maybe someday, some studio will make a great melee battle game but it pains me to say this isn't it. you'll have a few hours of fun maybe but then your left wanting more and wondering why this isn't early access or alpha build.",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is all about adventure, carnage, the jungle aspect and getting the best guns for your assault type. There are a lot of areas where FarCry succeeds but many more where it simply falls through the floor.   Far Cry 3 offers a compelling storyline through the singleplayer campaign. It is almost unrivaled and allows you to take hold of a person and watch them grow from a normal friend-loving schoolboy to a psuedo-psycho badass of the jungle.   Multiplayer is completely broken as there a lot of bugs and hiccups along the way. The loadout option is pretty much useless as there is currently one build that destroys anything else that you put against it.   Coop is a very welcomed theme within the Far Cry series, it's just a shame it wasn't implemented into the overall storyline. Or atleast contained within it's own world. Rather than you and a friend playing within the island sandbox, you are forced to go through objective-based and competition-based tasks that follow a very crappy storyline of 4 people just wanting to get rich and get out.   ++ Singleplay, Multiplayer and COOP modes.  + Guns and tools are nice + Great scenery  +++Buy this game for the singleplayer  - Multiple bugs - Uplay requirements/overlay - Game-breaking bugs - Overpowered SMG class - Graphics are similar to FC2 but..worse?   I would only recommend this game for the singleplayer and nothing else. The coop is fun if you're with the right people and playing on INSANE mode.  ",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Genueinly fun game with a ridiculous learning curve. There's an exploit/mechanic called 'dragging' that allows weapon swings to not match animations. The developers apparently intended for this to be in the game while conventiently not including it in the tutorial. I spent 21 hours playing this game thinking the hit detection was awful until a player told me that he was using a technique called dragging. I reasearched it online and laughed because suddenly all those times I was killed through a perfect block made sense.  If dragging was explained to new players I would probably give Chivalry a thumbs up and just say it's difficult. Unfortunately it's something that veteran players can use to incite rage in newer players, which I just can't look past. This would be a great game if the playing field was more suitable towards all players.  Disregard this review if you are looking for a skill based game and don't mind hidden mechanics.",-1,0,0
218230,PlanetSide 2,"I will never recommend this game to anyone. It's far beyond broken and uneven; saying that would mean it was once a pieced together &amp; functioning game.

This stuff is insanely abnoxius &amp; enraging. I've played this game for too long, putting up with the constant problems that plague this game, simply because of the community &amp; squad tactical approach - which by the way is the only real  way to get the most out of the game IMO. If you're not with a squad, then you mise well be playin' COD - at least that way you'll feel more on the level with other players.

265930,Goat Simulator,"Wow, well, this was just, Im sorry, but this game is awful, not that its not fun, which it isnt except for the first 5 minutes, YouTubers make it look REALLY fun when its not, I should stop with the rant and do the review i guess. Well, here are the catagories: Fun, Atmosphere, Physics, graphics, and the overall game. So, Without Further Ado:  Fun: 2.3/10 This game was only fun for the first five minutes, like i said, but it really is more than that, the jokes arent funny, the glitches are MEANT to happen, Which in my opinion led to its downfall. Make a goat simulator 2 without the ♥♥♥♥ing awful puns, jokes, and ♥♥♥♥, as well as dont revolve it around the physics, Well dont revolve it around BAD physics.  Atmosphere: 8/10 The Atmosphere in this is undeniably cool, you feel like youre actually in a city, Not with people, but the overall level design is pretty good, I have to admit  Physics: 1.4/10 The physics in this game is- ill just put it simply, ♥♥♥♥. its revolved around glitches and trying to make it all for laughs, the way this game bends physics are just awful, the gravity is off, the ragdolls dont change unless you MAKE them, some things dont even have physics, and it was unenjoyable.  Graphics: 7/10 Yes, I know that i have been harsh, but the graphics are pretty good, the shaders are beautiful, and you can tell exactly what everything is, there really is no low point to the graphics, but its not as good as, say the last of us, or other games.  Overall Game: 2.7/10 This game, when i got it, was Hyped SO much and i was SO excited, Everyone was playing it, then the game took a huge ♥♥♥ steamy ♥♥♥♥ on my hopes and dreams, The graphics and level design may be good, but not enough to change the gameplay, the jokes are ♥♥♥♥, as i said, the physics are ♥♥♥♥, the alternate goats you can play as, Such as an emu, or whatever they have, was a nice touch, i like that its not just goats, but the extra costume powers killed this part of the game.

Rather to the new players, who will have to endure the agony of basically shooting glowing cottonballs.    -HOWEVER-  Through the perspective of an open minded person this game actually isn't half too bad. It looks nice, plays smoothly and offers large scale battles, which i haven't seen since the days of Battlefront 2. in addition, the vehicles control rather fluidly and allow for smooth, quick movments.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I played this game in its early days and it was a fun, fantastic game.  Was.  Now the game borders on unplayable. Everything is unresponsive, weapons seem to have no clear advantages over another, everything just feels bland. When I first bought the game I played for hours at a time, I even convinced some friends to buy it. After playing it in its most recent iteration I am left with a bad taste in my mouth. Armor unlocks and paints and exp bars make the game more reminiscent of Call of Duty than an original game. Paints become borderline camouflage as it is difficult to see what team enemies with painted armor are on, and the exp bar for ranks makes the game feel more like a grind and less like a, well, game.  If you would've asked me a year ago, I would've recommended this game with no hesitation. Now, I urge you to buy with caution.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 was fun for a while, the alerts are fun and weapons are very well diverse for people to even customize them with whatever attachments they had available at the time, I have played all three sides, so I have read the chat of the three factions to see their opinions on each other. It's gotten even better since Daybreak does ban cheaters compared to the previous owner SOE. However, of my many times participating in some alerts there are some things I'd like to note for people playing this game either new or returning after a break, which would be some current events that have made it an issue to play this game.  1. The poor connection to this is pretty known to current and past players as even the devs are trying to fix this still, however that's not a real major issue compared to what I have seen.  2. Even though Daybreak bans cheaters all they do is create new accounts and get right back on and cheat again, teleporting behind players and using aimbot at point blank with a shotgun or an smg I have seen now and again. They still walk through walls at times and are reported then banned just to repeat the process all over again.  3. Then we have the outfits, there has been a major issue with every faction's outfits. There is a South Korean outfit for every faction, this wouldn't be too much of a problem if they hadn't actually flooded the Connery (American West) server, usually these outfits control these regions during an alert so I have no idea why they are not playing on their own server, all I know is that they have become far superior outfits to the others and no one really stands a chance anymore while some of us even have to wait to get into some warzones as the zone is completely full of people because of them. There are other awful outfits as they have recently done nothing but team kill other players trying to help them who are not on their outfit roster as I have been team killed by the same outfit over and over again under different circumstances. The strangest occasion being a 30 year old man strangely screaming 'Bad guy!' while I repair his vehicle as he proceeds to shoot and kill me my character says 'I fight for Vanu!' and the outfit proceeded to trash me because I was the little guy in no outfit at all since I didn't meet the 'requirements' of having a microphone. I actually had quit this game because of this very same outfit with their try hard people and some even being cheaters or just don't seem to even have any simple form of common sense.  3. The Terran Republic has a pretty bad reputation of having cheaters join their ranks while the New Conglomerate is considered to be the newbie group and is widely disrespected among the other factions except for the famous 666 Devildogs outfit being one of the very few with actual honor. (Not saying there aren't really any others with honor on different sides but not many actually punish team killing like they do unless apologies are said and people are revived.) The Vanu are considered 'overpowered' no matter what the circumstances seem to be and even have been nerfed by SOE in the past.  The game itself is fun, I loved playing it while being around the few good platoons left. But the community has become awful compared to what it used to be a couple years ago when I didn't play so much on a steam account. I have seen games change like this before and this game has become no different. It has become from a fun game with competition to a game that you will hands down lose because of the outfits being so close to each other that they'll kill any other person on the same faction but not the same outfit just for fun with no punishment other than 'locking' their guns for a period of time and not noticing that the person that they killed was the only support soldier in the local area. As I said, I had fun with this when I could, but there was no more fun to be had and I simply had to leave. People will say 'Well if you joined an outfit you'd still be playing and be having fun as this is a MMOFPS game.' Well, I didn't have enough time to join a outfit, nor did I plan to join one unless it was one of the more honorable ones for fear of being framed for being a team killer while I hate team killing all together, nor did I meet the requirements since I was waiting to buy another microphone.   Overall, I have to rate this game at a 3/10, it's not the worst free fps I've played (The worst being Blacklight: Retribution) since I love how the game works with the people being specific classes while handling jobs like piloting and I loved how teamwork used to be back then but the community once again ruined a good game. I'm sorry but I just can't recommend a game that puts a new player down so hard, or veteran players being attacked personally for the things they do in a game by children or lunatics to the point to where they switch to a similar war game searching for a better community. I honestly expect this game's American servers to be taken over by either South Korea or Russia within the next few years because they are the few outfits I actually saw who seem to just win every single time over any english speaking outfit and almost seem to always be on the Connery server. Sad to leave this game in the dust with a review that bashed it, but I used to love this game, I played a day straight getting certs for unlocking weapons and other useful things. Now it's a game where everyone doesn't trust their own team and would rather kill their own team than work with them.",-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"This game is not good. I very much want to like this game, but i just can't. Heres a collection of reasons why:  1: The story is crap. It's not engaging whatsoever, and its not even your story. You're just a tag-along most of the time, and even when you aren't you still never really feel like you are accomplishing anything.  2: You have no real choice in playstyle. You either shoot things, hit things, or blow things up. Thats it. No pacifist runs. This wouldn't be too big an issue if this was fun, but...  3: Combat is boring, just horribly boring. None of the weapons really pack any kind of punch, and in the end it just feels like you're shooting spitballs for all the balistic impact the weapons have. The melee weapons fare slightly better in this regard, but with exeption of a few lategame and unique weapons they just all feel the same; just with different damage numbers.  4: It looks like ♥♥♥♥. Now, I don't have anything against dated graphics, but the textures are just plain bad on a lot of things, at times worse than oblivion, and definetly worse than New Vegas, which is on the same engine. The omnipresent gray-green filter does not help this any.  5: The AI is terrible. Running into walls, spazing out, not reacting to being shot, the works.  6: It crashes a lot. These crashes are unavoidable in most cases, and can only be delayed by installing some unoficial patches and such.  7: The DLC. Its not great. Out of all of the DLC, only Point Lookout is really worth playing, and to a lesser extent The Pit.  Get Fallout: New Vegas instead. It is everything that this game should have been: Fun.",-1,0,0

A lot. The game is great, very solid, there is barely anything to complain about. But still the game gets bad reviews. Why? Because of dlc (that at the moment) isn't out yet. Blood and gore pack is a seperate dlc, because of age rating. It comes at the cost of 2,50 which to me doesn't seem like a lot. I mean, you can buy a coke for that money, maybe 2. Now for the chaos warriors dlc, this is one I'm also a bit icky about, but I still think it's not that bad. Yes, it should have been in the game by default, but most people got it for free anyway in the first week. Still I understand people are upset about this. Now for the 'call of the beastmen' dlc. People are, at this moment, leaving bad reviews on the base game, because of a dlc that isn't out yet. Yes, I do also feel it is a bit expensive, and the unit roster is too small. The solution? Don't buy it. If you don't feel like a dlc isn't worth your money, just don't buy it. It isn't like your obliged to do so.   Why did I write this paragraph about something as silly as this? I don't know, maybe I'm just an idiot, or maybe I don't want to see this game, which is one of the best warhammer games to date, see get buried in bad reviews. Oh well, I'm just one opinion of many, but thanks for taking the time to listen to mine.",1,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Tl;Dr - If you're looking for a quick fix for your Total War itch, don't bother here. If you really dig the fantasy setting or already own the previous Total War installments, get Warhammer at a 50% discount minimum. This should have been an expansion back for Attila (price point-wise).  I know I'll get a lot of flack for not liking this iteration of Warhammer come to life in an RTS game, but frankly, it's not the idea of Warhammer I don't like, it's the implementation. Essentially I was pleasantly surprised to see CA go after the Warhammer franchise. A franchise that combines fantasy and the joy of medieval combat sounds like a dream come true, right? Unfortunately, the result is far from the truth.  Quite frankly, this game is a dissapointment on so many levels for me. While you can still get enjoyment out of it, especially if you are a hardcore Warhammer fan, that does not make up for the sheer lack of overall effort that shows everytime you boot a game up. But enough of that, let's get started with the usual list!  Pros:  1. The graphics - The game looks good...I mean...REALLY good. It has plenty of visual flair and charm despite my growing distate for the game as a whole.  2. Leaders - For the most part each leader adds a new and interesting mechanic to your battles, a nice change of pace from the political setups from Rome 2 and Attila.  3. Siege and Regular Battles - Regular battles have different visual styles that vary based on location, whilst sieges can certainly look gorgeous they also have MAJOR cons that we'll get to shortly.  4. No Politics/children - This one just speaks for itself.  And now, the Cons:  1. Complete lack of quanitity - So, remember when I made the jab at Atilla with 'Attila Lite' in my last review? Yeah, Warhammer is even worse, which you would almost think to be impossible. Now I get that there are only so many races, but dear gods, one faction per race? Seriously? And people try to justify that? Basically if you want to play coop with someone you cannot be the same race despite there being multiple factions per race. You also cannot play a different faction after you've grown tired of playing the exact same starting position with the exact same enemies around you. And no, different lords do not add enough variety to change that.  2. Great Power Debuff - This one just speaks for itself.  3. Agents - It was a pretty cool idea to have 'heroes' that you can use to bolster your army, such as using a Dwarven Engineer to increase the stats and reload speed of your artillery. Each hero has unique abilities for each race and you could really benefit from them in battle....oh...you say that the AI will only use them like agents from the previous Total War games and eventually you'll be dealing with the six or so agents from all your enemies that are completely unstoppable just like Attila? Well that was a waste of time.  4. Enemy Units Routing...Psych! - Yeah, this is probably the worst and most unrealistic part of Warhammer, a univese with gryphons (griffons?) and dragons. Picture this, you're in a close battle with the enemy lord, your troops have flanked his best warriors and you've decimated the enemy archers and horseman. Now all that's left is to bring this battle to a clo-....wait....why are my Hammerers dropping like flies? *glance around map for hidden units* Why the hell is that archer unit of only 10-20 men back in battle? ♥♥♥♥♥! How did that horseman unit of 15 come back and flank my warriors?! Yeah, get ready for this constantly happening. It's annoying and drags out battles for far too long. You'll constantly find weak units coming back. My advice? Don't even bother playing the dwarves if that annoys you. The Slayers are the only thing you'll have that can run down those units to make sure they don't come back.  5. Settlements/Cities - Wow do these look half-♥♥♥♥♥, just from the in-game ui alone. Do you remember Yu-Gi-Oh? How about Pegusus' Toon world? Yeah. That's pretty much what every city looks like from the grand campaign...toon towns.  6. Siege Battles - And now for the largest let down of all. I'm sure you've already heard of this, but siege battles suck. About 1/4 of the city is available to you, limiting your encirclment options to a head-on charge, Units pull ladders out of their hidden bags of holding, lodged somewhere securely in their rears, and when you get on the enemy walls? Yeah, your units get down by clipping through the battlements...Such a showcase of effort and time right there. But the worst part? The cities actually look really good, especially the background art. All of which just makes you wish for an actual siege battle like the previous games.  7. Siege Battles Continued - Settlements don't have siege battles unless you've builts walls. What does that mean? It means no more using choke points to your advantage on low level settlements, instead you get to fight on a generic battle map. I guess those budget cuts even hit your engineers.  At the end of the day, the best I can say about Warhammer is that it looks pretty. That it has potential. But sadly there's very little effort and quality here, especially when compared to previous Total War entries (Attila included). The lack of faction choices within each race is a sour taste every time you start a new game, especially so if you plan to play coop. Creatively, Warhammer is a step in the right direction for CA, but from a mechanic and quality standpoint it's miles behind Shogun 2.  9/25 Edit - Spell check",-1,1,0

570,Dota 2,"What is Dota 2?  Dota 2 is an art form. With its own take on the MOBA gaming genre, Dota 2 has etched its place within gaming history. As more and more players flock to check out the generously free-to-play game, one must ask - What is it thats so appealing?  The free-to-play is certainly an excellent carrot, and you get an astounding amount of content for that free-to-play tag. Every hero unlocked, and a complete even playing field. The only thing you can buy is cosmetic upgrades and battlepoint boosters which - You guessed it, improve your chance of more cosmetic upgrades. The fact that both paying and free-to-play customers are on an even playing field is attractive already.  Back in the Beta, I paid the £15. Im glad I did, because I know that money went to developing an amazing game. But in its heart, in its very essence, Dota 2 has a learning curve the size of a cliff. You dont just play Dota 2, you -learn- it. Knowledge is power and without knowledge you are nothing in this game. You'll spend your first 30+ hours being stomped, smashed, brutalised and annihilated into the floor. And yet, you never feel bad about it. Every death is a chance to improve, every pub stomp is a chance to reflect on where you went wrong.  Even now I'm improving my game, every game. But once you pass that initial curve. Once you can jump into any hero and play them 'Comfortably' then Dota 2 moves on to something even better. I'm at that stage now, and yet I know that even now I have to improve my game every match.

570,Dota 2,"TL;DR: No, items aren't useful enough and punishment for deaths are too harsh. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To be honest, despite the low amount of hours I have on this game, I would not recommend this game by any means to anyone who wants to play a Moba and aren't gods at them. Two big reasons:  One: Items.  Most items are very useful and easy to use, but simply don't offer enough in terms of defense against stacked characters. No matter the items, if you are versing a Lion who is decent enough, he will kill you unless you or others kill him first.  Two: The biggest one, YOU ARE PUNISHED FOR SUCKING NO MATTER YOUR SKILL LEVEL Yeah, this might seem weird, you would want people to be punished for doing bad, but apparantly to Valve missing out on XP and possible kills isn't bad enough. So they thought about how else could they punish someone who is sucking, no matter if they legitimately don't know what they are doing or if they just are having a bad game, and it struck them: Let's have them lose gold. Yeah, if you are having a bad game, you will never come back from it because you'll never have the gold to get the items to help you. It's a simply screwed system that can't be fixed.  So yeah, thanks for reading this through if you did.",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"*** This review is 'NOT' about the game, but Uplay, as this is the fundamental cause of all problems. And stop complaining without reading my review. Or if you think I have something against the game, then by all means, stay ignorant. This negative review is about Ubisoft, and Uplay, NOT Far Cry 3. ***  First of all, I have loved Ubisoft back in the old days, and I thought they were one of the best game companies.  Now? I think it is one of the worst.   First of all, let me ask, what the hell is Uplay? And how am I supposed to make this god-awful client even work? I start Far Cry 3 from desktop, by clicking on the icon and nothing happens. But on Steam, it says the game is running. So I have to shut down the game manually....which is not really running in reality. And then I try starting the game from Uplay and I see where it says 'Play', but it doesn't look like it is highlighted and not really clickable. In fact, it is not clickable. So then why is it there?   So....I downloaded the Uplay client itself and tried to play it from Uplay directly. Oh, now 'Play' button is clickable there, Yay! Click! It says the game is running on Steam, but I do not see anything again.   I actually installed it once, removed, and re-installed and still nothing is happening. Let's see, Ubisoft, uh, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING ONE OF THE WORST CLIENTS MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN.   And guess what, it doesn't seem like I am the only person here. Google 'farcry 3 uplay not working' and see for yourself how many people are having problems with this garbage-like client.   Or you need even more proof? Go to the store page of Far Cry 3. And check out the negative reviews on this game. They are mostly about UPLAY.  I have found a few solutions for this, and well, some of the suggestions are to remove certain files, install some new driver, go into some folder and change something........uh....I bought the game, and I have to put up with all this garbage? They might as well put up a warning sign that reads 'This game has one of the worst clients that will drive you nuts, so if you don't think you are sure about your PC being able to run the game because of Uplay, then you might want to reconsider purchasing.'  GFWL was not that good, but not as bad as this. EA Origin is not bad, but it's actually pretty good. Steam, is definitely one of the best.   Uplay? Pure garbage, in fact, it really proves the whole point of Ubisoft being one of the worst companies in the world.   May I ask why Uplay is necessary? Is it necessary?   Ubisoft has the history of screwing up the PC ports of Devil May Cry 3 and Resident Evil 4, the old PC version.    If this is how they are going to do business, well, then I think their games are not worth full price, at all. I am glad I got this POS when it was on a sale.   How is the game? How the HELL am I supposed to know? Uplay is not letting me play, so well, I wish I could tell you?   But I can tell you how the client was.   A complete piece of GARBAGE. Will NEVER pay more than 10 dollars to an Ubisoft game, ever again. They obviously have NO CLUE how to do business. Even though Activision sells the same stuff Call of Duty every friggin year, they at least NEVER make a stupid-♥♥♥ garbage client like this.  Oh, I'm sure the game is good. It really looks fun. But if I can NOT EVEN LAUNCH IT...then what?    ZERO (0) out of 10 for Uplay. UBISOFT = UPLAY = COMPLETE FAIL.  For the game Far Cry 3, I give '?' out of 10.

265930,Goat Simulator,"What is Goat Simulator?  Recently there has been a lot of hype revovling around this game for its randomness and such, but is it really worth it to buy and play? Better question, will this game last you a long time, or at least long enough to get maybe a decent amount of hours in before your sick of it? For I regretably found the creul truth of this game, it's just not enough fun. There isn't nearly enough fun, wacky things to do as a goat in this game to keep you occupied. Of course, just as I did, you'll have an hour or so when you'll say something like'BEST GAME EVER!', later you'll find out it's more of a in the moment feeling. I did have a good hour or so when it felt like it was so much fun, not knowing what to screw up as a goat next, but then very soon it was evident, the game got boring. (THE GAME LIVES OFF THE FACT OF YOU BEING A GOAT TOO MUCH!!!)  What do you do in the game?  The game consists of you, a goat, being well, a goat. You basically terrorize a small(and I mean SMALL) town and do what ever you really feel like whether it's ruin a family's dinner or grab a big boulder with your tounge and hurt stuff(kind of fun). Your main things you can do are move around with the W,A,S,D keys(duh), run with the shift key, use the E key to grab to stuff with your tounge and take it somewhere(maybe out for dinner?) and of course jump with the SPACE BAR. Also as you do more things in the game more small abilities unlock like the GOATBORN, which is basically you being able to Fus Ro Da as a goat, which I admit, can be fun.  Should I Buy This Game?  Really I don't know if I can tell you the answer completly, but I may be able to push a little towards my idea of the situation. This game is is fun for only how long you let it be fun. By that I mean it's fun only if you sort of have an imagination or like just messing around with no real incentives, or goals. Personally, when I play a game I feel I need some sort of goal to push towards and acheive because well that's sort of what makes a lot of games fun. Now there are a few small 'goals' you can do, but nothing really worth going into depth like doing a backflip, but earning nothing in return, horay. So if you want to spend 10$ on this game go ahead, just remember, the game in a nutshell dosen't have much substance to it so it won't last long if you don't like just messing around.  NOTE: Also just like to note that there isn't any multiplayer, but there is a workshop kind of thing where you can doownload other people's maps, which could grant a few more hours of play.   VERDICT: 7/10 It's Ok  Pro Your a goat Gives you a good laugh Only 10$(Could also be a con couldn't though?) Good if your bored one afternoon and have nothing to do   Con Causing destruction and such gets old after a while Graphics glitch out(I realize that it's suppose to be in the game, but can be annoying) No goals or at least anything really worth striving to do  Costs 10$  ",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"One of the best games of all time. What I love about it is that there are vehicles, jungle with animals, hunting, crafting, gun combat, stealth combat... and every single aspect of that game is perfectly balanced with others. This allows you to clear camps with many different styles, but each of which is rewarding: - you can rush in all guns blazin' - you can sneak in - you can release animal - you can shoot them up from a distance with a sniper rifle - you can set whole place on fire -YOU CAN BRING RANDOM BEAR TO THEIR BASE WITH STONES and enjoy the show.  I love this kind of freedom, especially when everything is at the top of its genre - you will have trouble finding better stealth game, better action game, better jungle (you are scared and hoping that you wont find tiger/bear/... on your walks), more immersive driving (in not carsim games that is).  After all is said and done, you have this kind of freedom only in Skyrim and maybe (didn't play yet) in GTA V. For example assassins creed 3 doesn't have that - yes you can do many things in it, but those things are not interconnected and balanced to provide one great package - you have hunting there, but no reason to hunt - same goes for (awesome) ship missions, stealth is broken, bullet shield mechanic is hillarious, forest animals are almost unable to kill you... this just shows how unique far cry is.",1,0,1

When the mmr released, i didn't think it's important and still thought it would be level matchmaking, till my mmr was dropped really low , then i changed my thought that the more low , the more noob players you were going to meet.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is like CS but with swords. And gore. And fire. Lots of fire. The game is what I consider a 'Server-Based-Game' where there is no story or campaign but rather you get a big list of servers and you choose a game to play in. Similar to TF2, CS, ect. Normally I don't like games like these because I do enjoy -some- story to go with my game before I jump into multiplayer. I discovered however that Chivalry does in fact have just that! The Blue Agatha's are fighting against the Red Mason's who are rebelling against the kingdom! And that's it. That's all I need. The decapitations in Chivalry are always amazing to see and perform on people and surprisingly the games hit detection is really well done for a first person sword game. You wouldn't think it would be as polished as it is, yet the game is amazingly well crafted for being indie. The combat is fast, dynamic, and if you want a Medieval campagin to go with it then I recommend picking up Mount and Blade: Warband. Both games go great together and play very similar! I love Chivalry and it's one of those games that goes perfectly with a good music playlist going in the background. I'll give Chivalry an 8/10. I would rate it higher but I think the game needs more maps! Other than that: It's GREAT!",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3," Singleplayer : Campaign: I played the campaign on it's hardest difficulty and it took me somewhere around 15 hours. The story is about Jason Brody having a vacation on an island. And wakes up in a cage realising that his vacation is over and he has to save all his friends so they can get back home. This sounds and also felt generic. But as you continue through the game the story gets more and more interesting, due to well voiced characters and the inspiring monologues. The game also felt like some kind of total recall to me, because the character has many drug trips. So even when I was playing the normal sp missions I was asking myself if it wasn't just a drug trip. Because if the bulk of the story was a drug trip the story would make a lot more sense. The campaign story was mostly the reason that kept me playing.   Gameplay: The gameplay other hand was good and entertaining, but nothing special for me. Some early missions could be annoying, because you were forced to play stealthily. Also the sp missions can sometimes feel as a narrow route. The power of the gameplay itself is that you can choose how you want to play. stealthily or guns blazing. Both can be fun but both also have some issues. The stealth problem is that the ai can be annoying. And for guns blazing you can easily run out of ammo and have to break your arm to revive yourself many times if you play guns blazing.(Atleast on my difficulty. I would maybe recommend to play 1 difficulty below or first do a lot of side missions to unlock more health, weapons etc.) Also if you have no ammo you mostly have to camp until you can easily knife someone, without getting hit. Sadly every endboss fight from the game showed the definition of insanity in gameplay. The game was also a bit overwhelming in the beginning because of the many menus with upgrades. At first I ignored them, but later I really saw the benefit of it. Otherwise you will easily die. The graphics of the game still look nice, I especially liked the lighting. And how much effort there had been put into the building.   Open World: I have to be honest I haven't done that much in it. Because I wasn't really interested in it. Still I can say if you are interested in exploring the world there is alot to do! There are enough side-missions, which is mostly killing enemies/animals in a certain way, missions where you have to go from A to B as fast as you can etc and, of course, collecting stuff. Really the only thing that made me stop fast-traveling from mission to missions was the tower climbing and the animal/flower hunt to unlock stuff. They were more rewarding to me than the side missions that just give you money and xp that I already had enough of.    Online :  Multiplayer: In my opinion the mp isn't that special. It has 4 standard game modes. Of course they are varied with some nice ideas. But to me it just feels like a cod-clone. The multiplayer also has a strong map editor. Probably at the time there were many great mods made. (I found some interesting ones on youtube. ) But now that the game isn't as active anymore, I couldn't find a modded map to play. -Co-op: I played the co-op with someone many months before continuing my singleplayer campaign. It was pretty long at 6-8 hours. But still the co-op was pretty generic and forgetable. The only thing that I liked were the mini-games. What is strange is that the multiplayer and the co-op leveling system are combined. So if I had only played Co-Op, I would have all the unlocked loadouts for the multiplayer.    Overall : I can say Farcry 3 is a great game, but you can ignore the multiplayer and co-op, because they aren't that special and that active anymore. I think for the people who only own FarCry 4, FarCry 3 is still a great game to play, especially for the campaign, that makes it something special.",1,1,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Literally the worst voice sound quality I have ever heard. It sounds like Ubisoft recorded all the character voices over a mobile phone then compressed them down to 48 kb/s .mp3s. If that makes sense to you this game will drive you mental.   Also, it comes with pointless Steam-esque publisher bloatware.  Pretty fun, though.",-1,0,0
220240,Far Cry® 3,"Porbably the best storyline of any RPG not made by Bethesda. Definately the most fun I have had playing an FPS EVER.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"You only need to click, but then after a while you really need to click.  Simple graphics, like a fight screen from an old RPG like Dragon quest, and a fluid growth curve that sees your many heroes becoming stronger every time you return to them. Truly free to play as you can just keep clicking and you will be given the 'Rubys' that are the in-game currency. You will have enough to buy the most valuable things in no time.  The real trick is knowing where to invest your earnings, and going after the right powers, or achievements that will either increase your attack power or that of the heroes that you collect, and upgrade. at times the heroes are all very strong, and other times all of the power is coming from just 1 or 2 of them.  At the time of this review I am 14.1 hours in, I have reached level 137, and I have over 50 rubys already. I have 1 hero soul, and if I ascended now I would get 9 souls, and the 3 gilded heroes will go with me. (4 if I wait till I kill the boss on 140 I'm certain) but I won't be ascending for at least another 50 levels. when I have rounded each hero to at least level 1000 that will be the day. Now I must click. (Only 60K more clicks to 250K) I have spent nothing, and I got a booster pack for being online with Steam as well so that is like being paid even if only pennies to play this free game.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry was looking like it was going to be one of my favorite games of all time until I reached level 16. From level 0-15, this game has servers exclusively meant for new players which is pretty cool. These servers are full of intense battles and fun combat scenarios, lots of fun! You may ask how the hell this game just becomes bad at level 16. Well, when you jump in your first non 0-15 server, it is likely that you will be called out for being a 'noob'. This part doesn't bother me as trashtalk is common among many games nowadays, so I say 'whatever- I'll just prove them wrong with my swordplay'. The first ♥♥♥♥ing person I fight kills me with 2 seemingly unblockable swings. I think this is odd considering the swings looked fairly straightforward. 'No big deal. I'll just try again' *same thing happens* 'must be my ping'! *ping is at 42*.  After this, I just kept having this exact experience over and over. After many rage inducing games, I quit the game and did some research.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 is a post-apocalyptic nightmare. Things will scare you. Things will gnaw at your soul at night.  I would recommend playing 3 before New Vegas. Why?  I think so many players were bothered by Fallout 3 not being as funny or witty as the other games because Fallout 3 is literally the deconstruction of the Fallout universe. It's the real dark nightmares of Fallout, because there's no NCR, there's no Master, no ghoul city... There's nobody out here. The city was annihilated. Whatever's left are just dregs.  In New Vegas you have hope humanity will rebound in one way or another. It's just a question of picking your faction. I mean the Followers of the Apocalypse are already working on ways to replace ancient technology with newer methods that can be reproduced. The NCR has water purifiers. Legion lands are free of raiders. House is a giant mainframe with self-replicating robots at his disposal.  In 3 you have no such hope. In 3, even the Brotherhood of Steel realized it was pointless, the struggle was futile.  It crashes harder than a Fiend on Jet though. There's tricks to making it work better, but save early, save often. Just wish Bethesda re-released this without GFWL.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Good potential spoiled by game developers A) forcing you to play oline; you cannot play as a single player against the AI in anything other than the most basic games, and B) MASSIVE lag on the controls means incredibly unresponsive controls. if you get hit, you will not be able to counterstrike immediately. If you have made a strike already but get hit first, your strike will be voided. Then you won't have enough time to strike before getting struck first, meaning you get hit again and just die. If you block with your shield, then try to strike back, there is a HUGE delay, your opponent will then hit you first, after your skillful block and kill you, meaning that blocking with a shield is effectively completely useless. The combat has more complexity than Skyrim, but the MASSIVE unrensponsiveness ruins it, you can't use your skill to win, it's just the first man to make a hit on the opponent will win! Very VERY disappointing. Why do the game developers make games like this, it's just poinless!",-1,0,0

It was the only game I saw commercials for that didn't rhyme with 'Cattlefield' or 'Cacaw of Duty' that had so much hype seeping out of the TV. I thought to myself  'Cold! What a wonderful idea! You've always wanted to simulate a goat-based reality. Or was it an Earth-based goat reality? Doesn't matter! You've purchased this game. It's your rite of passage as a gamer to play this game.'   So what did I think? It was OK. I feel like I hopped on the Hype Train in a village with the population of 1 person. After getting the gist of the game, I felt like I should be playing this game with someone else. Or perhaps with a group of people whilst intoxicated and/or pretending to be intoxicated for fear that Mary will think I'm a deviant drug user and won't go to the prom with me!. Well that's fine. If she won't go to the prom with me, I'll spread a rumor that she never even tried Goat Simulator! That'll ruin her gaming cred!  Where was I? Oh, right. It was a bit easy for me to get bored while playing this game. Oh well. I had high hopes. I'm going to not recommend this game, solely because the Hype Train has left Goatsville.  Oh, snap!

363970,Clicker Heroes,"I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Why, you may ask? Simply because of the fact that its purely meant to consume your time.   You kill mosters by clicking or idling and use the gold which they drop to improve your character and buy heroes and imrpove those. So far for that. You do that until you reach lvl 130-140 where you simply never ever will pass the bosses. (too low dmg) Then, you restart the game. You gain Hero Souls, which give you dmg boosts if you keep them or can be used to buy other extras.  Thats it. You play the game util you can't proceed any further, then you resett, gain hero souls, play until you [...]  As always, there is the shortcut of paying. You can pay to improve your heroes, you can pay for hero souls, you can pay for relics, you can pay for basicly anything you want.   So... either play this for hundreds / thousands of hours (because there is no 'end' unless you count 100% achievements as finishing a game) or you ... quit halfway through. Optional, you don't play it at all, which i advise you to do.  The game is soley a waste of time and trying to get you spend money on it.",-1,1,0

Not a small feild with nothing on it. Magic is pointless. Dont buy. If this game was bigger. An epic scale for fantasy battles. And its so simple. Its like a kids game. Agree or not.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"A great game with a not-so-great story. Far Cry 3 has a very solid gameplay aspect to it. I love roaming around the jungle, gathering plants for potions, hunting animals for their skins and upgrading my equipment and killing mad baddies. I love activating the radio towers for more weapons and to reveal more of the map and I love trying to unlock the signature weapons. I enjoy that the collectibles that aren't impossible to find, but that's not my thing really. If you enjoy them, you'll like this game. The gun's are awesome, and for once, the melee isn't useless if you know when to use it! I played this game through on hard and the difficulty was perfect for me, as I died multiple times, but still felt like I was making progess. Except some times when it throws you back 5-10 minutes on a really hard mission multiple times, but fortunately this is very rare. Now the story on the other hand is very basic, and after about 2/3 through the game it get's dreadfully boring. You'll see why. But if there is one thing I love about the story it's one character. The character who single-handedly saves this game's story. Vaas, the main villain, a maniac pirate who loves to tell you the meaning of insanity. Sadly the other characters are boring or just plain annoying (except for Dennis, he cool mang.) This game's advertised as a game that breaks the rules of story-telling games' cliches, but honestly it follows many of them. Except every once in a while it throws some crazy-♥♥♥ riddles at you that go away so quickly you don't even have time to think them through. And the ending, in my opiniion, is the worst thing since Shaquille O'Neal's acting career, but some people think it's fine. Even after that rant I still enjoyed this game a lot, and you can see I played it as a single-player game even though it has a multiplayer aspect to it. So if you're into that, this game has it too!  I'll give this game a 8/10 for it's amazing gameplay and Vaas.",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Firstly, I have to tell you that I really love this game, total war with fantasy settings, but I can't recommend this game as it is overpriced due to the starting contents and other gameplay issues. Noted that; my game is still the base game without additional dlc at all (except for Warrior of Chaos from pre-ordering).  I have been playing total war series since shogun 2 (except Attila) and find out that there are various new features as well as missing features, but maybe it's because they have to make it lore-friendly which I don't know any background info about warhammer universe.  The campaign map is divided into many provinces with several settlements, but when it is leveled up, the icon of the building does not distinguish at all and the size of the city does not expand like in Rome II. This makes the city's defense range (I mean the aura around the city) too small to gain strategic positon as the campaign map is the vast plain with some mountainous area.  Although I like the underground stance that make you be able to march through the mountain, lack of river and bridge is another issue that almost every single battle I have faced is a wasteland with some hills and forests. However as I've said, the original warhammer Old World mays limit these issues.  For factions, each race is designed to have their own playstyle which is a great step because in other previous total war games, each faction is slightly differentiated with only a distinguished buff. Nonetheless, within the same race but different faction, it is not likely to be unique for the playstyle as it is very similar with each other with additional contents (from DLC :P) e.g. Dwarf and Clan Angrund.  The politic panel in Rome II is also missing together with the family tree. Again I know that it is lore-friendly, but if we can play in our own story, it will be very interesting. Shogun II can auto-generate sons and daughters so the orc or dwarf or vampire in total war Warhammer should be able to do that too.  Lastly, the siege battle which should be an epic moment for us. Even though it is exciting to see the beautiful background of the city itself in the battle, the wall is in only one side in the north or south or in the corner of the map. Therefore, it is very limited for you to siege from only one direction instead of surrounding it from several points. Furthermore, the most annoying thing is the siege battle map is so small that once the battle starts, you will almost always under-fire from the tower. Even at the furthest part outside the city, my units keep dying so the only choice is to charge in.  Therefore, if you want this game, I recommend to buy it on sale.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I really do like this game, I like the concepts and everything for it. I wish they would introduce positional blocking (similar to what they have done for attacks) to keep it interesting.  I have some very large complaints about the game however, firstly, the keybinds are fairly complex and should vary from character to character. I enjoy setting things up so that the origin side of the swing comes from the same side as the button I am pressing (to keep it logical). However since all keybinds are set together as 'offside swing' or 'mainside swing' some characters will swing from the opposite side when you use the same button. I really wish that you could have profiles for character archetype to change that.  The second large issue has to do with what I see 'good' players doing. I enjoy parrying and poking and fighting with people and enjoy that kind of engagements. However, what the good players do is more a fault of how the hit detection works. Basically 'if a sword on a swing touches you, you take damage', so what do good players do to upgrade their chances to land hits? They abuse the system, they literally spin backwards to block and then overhead swing because it instantly throws the sword overhead scoring a hit, or they grab a two handed sword, after a block they look flat at the ground and crouch and it insta-hits the people in front of you. These types of game mechanics make me not want to play the game at all because you cannot block fast enough to deal with it.  The game IS still pretty fun regardless of the glaring issues, in fact the new player introduction stuff and the first 10/15 levels (whatever new player games a limited to in levels) were great! The problem is that beyond that there are at least 2 people abusing the broken mechanics in each game. If you still want to continue playing I would recommend playing in a server that disables third person view, as from my experience the people using instant hit abilities have a harder time with that disabled (especially the 1h sword ones where you have to block backwards).",-1,0,0

(the DLCs aren't even cheap at all)  Still out of all Total War games i like this one the best. Basically because Warhammer in general is pretty awesome with its fantasy universe.  The different factions are great, but still there are a lot of them missing. Also the diplomacy could be better, the only thing it is good for is declaring wars, especially as Orcs you don't have any diplomacy really.  Like in the rome games they should unlock every faction that is on the map so you would be able to play them. At least in multiplayer.

Adendum. Team Death Match: It's possible on most maps in this mode, not all but enough to make it a reoccuring theme, to get spawn killed because the devs were lazy and decided to take a smaller section of one of their objective maps without a safe spawn area and put a spawn point out in the open.

But I just love the Warhammer setting, I suppose the medieveal part even more than the 40000 part. Additionally I already played a game which was kind of like TWW, it's called 'Warhammer: Mark of Chaos' (I can only recommend it). I've been playing it averagely 5 hours every day for the last 2 weeks, mostly the empire in different difficulties but also with mods, especially to my liking was the 2 Skillpoints instead of one. Unfortunately I'm a newbie reagarding Total War games so I cannot really say anything about it except that I found it quite hard to match the yellow bar indicating your strength of force compared to the enemy when I was fighting the battles myself. But I guess in all of us there is a more or less big conqueror who just wants to see the world burn and his heroes levelled up. The lords and heroes were the part which kept me going the most because I just love strategy games and RPGs combined. To see my imperial lords receive their griffon and/ or pegasus or the zombie dragon for the Vampire Counts was simply thrilling, even the third time. Not only in battle you can see them but also on your campaign map.  So all in all the best 50€ I have ever invested in a game.

Being a very conservative player who doesn't like to pace I found the Empire and Dwarves to be the only viable options, that´s my personal flaw and I cant blame the devs for not pleasing my personal wishes. I would at least have wished for 7-8 playable factions but the good thing about the existing ones is that they differ from one another.  I would personally have loved if they had gone much further in the narrative development into one of the factions, you are told a story as you progress doing certain objectives. They could have made this an optional feature as all the requirements for a traditional sandbox play was already present. I wasn't however expecting this as a feature, I was merely hoping they would please us narrative driven folks.  I do still enjoy a good strategy game and TW: Warhammer delivers for the most part with the traditional battle setups, diplomacy, wars and choices within the different factions campaigns. There are however no battle formations, only the choice between ranged and melee at the front and the whole strategy map and faction choices seem a bit dumbed down from a game like Shogun 2. The game is fairly friendly to beginners though once they get accustomed to the battle scenarios.  Its a decent interpretation of the Warhammer universe with lots of fun battles to experience and the 5 existing faction do provide variety. My personal wishes wont interfere with my verdict of the game, it gets a 7/10 from me.",1,1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"So....   Like everyone, with at least two braincells to rub together, and who have lived long enough to see the Ninentdo 64 be an upcoming console, it will suffice to say that this game plays good and the factions are diverse and work different enough to be fun and good to play. It is a step in the right direction compared to the cancer of Rome 2 and the repulsive filth that Attila was.  I will not really provide critique against the game itself, i don't have any real complaints about the basegame itself.  We all know what most complaints contain when it's about the shady ♥♥♥♥♥ at CA and Sega... They are like the evil twins.   The mallpractice and filthy exploitation of capitalism is repugnant and disgusting. On a sidenote it is also infuriating. I get that not every race can be implemented in the basegame as it takes so much effort and you have a family to feed.  If we lived in Animal Farm by George Orwell Sega and CA would be the filthy pigs calling the shots whilst pretending to act on our best intrests,, which is a big fat lie.   At any rate we all know the drill... You done goofed again CA, ya done goofed again. You make a good game and then your greedy black hand of death sweeps all over your garden and kills it all off.   Here's why:  1. Total War: Warhammer:  Good, not superb but good. One step forward but still 2 steps back from Rome 2 and Attilla. I probably will never forgive you for that trash.  Also the game seems to focus more on the battles which is not too bad but since they have gone through the effort of taxes, diplomacy and riots. a bit more depth would have been appreciated. They did in pre Rome 2 games.  The city building, diplomacy, everything that has nothing to do with fighting has been stupefied and made way too simple. You grow tired of it quickly and getting progress no longer feels like something to be satisfied about.  The game is made more casual ofcourse to appeal to a wider audience to rake in more cash as every other single game dev does. So the complaints are minor. I have already taken peace with the lowering of standards and the applauding and encouraging of weakness and impatience.  2. Blood for the blood god or rather the best title the community has given:  Finger for the Finger God ....................../´¯/)  ....................,/¯../  .................../..../  ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸  ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\  ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')  .........\.................'...../  ..........''...\.......... _.·´  ............\..............(  ..............\.............\  Shouldn't have to pay for something that should be a checkbox in the options menu.  TO INFERNAL HELL WITH THIS DISGUSTING PUSS RIDDEN CHEAPSHOT DLC. IT IS ♥♥♥♥ING MALLPRACTICE.  And then these disgusting missed oppurtunities of abortion proclaim this: 'BUT Age restrictions would lessen sales so DIES DLC IS GEWD. FINK ABUUT DA LITTUL KIDS ANON, DLC GEWD... '  Any parent that actually knows what their kids get into will turn off that option or not let them play that game. And CA can just make it a hidden option that you could reveal via a sideway. No toddler will ever come up with unless it reads the forums but we all know they don't hence they can't read more than: THIS GAME IS BAD.. so they can thumb down reviews.   3. Warriors of Chaos:  ♥♥♥♥ me right? Ye olde world is all about the end times and the coming of chaos, but NO make a cash barrier. ' These fat gaming junkies WILL pay to play the big antagonist of the game.' Totally no evil greedy intent in that DLC, not all. Think about the Age restriction, big muscled half naked men in beast furs, that would get the sales down because the kids couldn't play it and some corporate uptight ♥♥♥♥ would say the game is not meant for small angsty teens.  ♥♥♥♥ ME RIGHT? Pay to play Chaos warriors in ♥♥♥♥ing Warhammer.. ♥♥♥♥ me sideways.  4. Beastmen:  I do not know, i have not bought it. And here is way: I am not paying 18 units of cash on a race that probably does not contain even half of the Beastmen units... and i don't care about the campaign, not one bit.  18 euro for a race and some campaign is WAY above the expected, tollerable level. And ♥♥♥♥ your arguments of entitlement. There is a thin line between being sceptic and being a gullible ♥♥♥♥.  And also not all people feel like they should spend so much money for so little content. Some people wonder why they pay certain ammounts of cash for certain products. Yet the existence of a company like Apple, proves rarely anyone does.   And even if you disagree with the above, not everyone has one single hobby in life. Most people have multiple financial vices that force them to calculate and keep their mind on spending a budget for leisure and you want the best optimal leisure for your cash. But the only argument people come up with are the following:  You are poor. You are entitled. You are a ♥♥♥.  The latter being the best arguement. As long as people keep spamming recycled cumdumpster garbage quotes. you'll know this entertainment sector is butt♥♥♥♥ed on annihilating levels.    End of rant.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'm going to be honest. In my eight hours playing this game, I've had good times, and I've had bad.  But overall, I'm going to have to give this game a no.  Allow me to explain.  The combat is heavily skill based, relying on you learning how to ' Get Gud '. While this is usually perfectly fine, and I enjoy a challenge, it does not work well when most of the rest of the community has two bodies, and a spare leg and a head above you in experience.  You will rarely find other players that are at the start of the leveling tier. Why? Because most are turned away by the sheer cliff of difficulty when it comes to learning the moves of the game, and actually being able to combat people who have done it for far longer than you, of which is little to impossible.  It gets worse when most of these high level players stack on their own team, making it impossible to make a dent, and ending with the match being steamrolled.  I had fun at times, but overall, there's more rage than fun to be found here.  I cannot reccommend this game, at this time.  I'd more than happy give this another shot, if some sort of rank matchmaking system were implemented, placing you in games with people of your own level of skill. But unfortunately, even servers ment for someone of my skill level, are filled with players levels 20+, who mow down people like me in a moment.  This needs to be fixed. Hopefully, someday it will.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Coming from an Age of Chivalry background, long time player, I've recently decided to purchase both the original and the expansion. The time I've spent on this game, it was an awkward trade of fun and frustration, the only fun I had was when I wielded a 2 handed spear, how it provided me with enough distance to poke enemies to death easily, yet what I really looked forward in this game was being an archer, or for the expansion, being a pirate.   If you purchase this game, don't bother much with range weapons, either you're good enough to hit a human with an ant-size bullet/arrow, or be killed easily by a spear and shield Spartan, given the reason that range classes have poor melee weapons, pirates have a default short sword which is not going to save you from a 2 handed sword landing a building breaking smash over your defenseless head. Not only I find it rather annoying and difficult to land a shot, but reloading takes all of your patience, especially crossbow, the character would bend over, spending about 3 seconds to reload and when the character gets up, you only see the tip of a spear ramming down your eye, nonetheless whether you score the shot or not, it only takes about a few percent of life, you still need to draw your safety-precaution approved sword and land a few hits.    I feel the game is unbalanced, for that reason, you barely see range weapons, just Spartans, Knights, Vikings, and some Samurai around. Because people like to win easily, they would rather sprint towards you, slice you in half before you even get a chance to respond, given the fact that it takes time to swap weapons and mispressing would lead to swapping back to another weapon, not to mention if you are reloading and get hit, your weapon remains unloaded. My biggest complaint is with range classes, they are plain hard to use, forcing most people to for the easy win classes. I wouldn't recommend this game if you like pirates, playing as one, or unbalanced games.",-1,0,0

The combat is 'floaty', slow and lacks any feel. You simply wave your weapon in front of you and either you or the opponent dies. There really doesn't feel like any connection at all between the weapons or direction of the supposed strike from you or your advesary. Perhaps the worst aspect is the glitching, where players will skip across the map, only slighty, but for no reason at all, even when played on high ends PC's with very low ping servers.

One might be able to make an argument for some of the DLCs being overpriced (Honestly I feel like Beastmen was overpriced and that Chaos should have been in the base game) but that doesn't detract from the solidness of the base game and it seems like things are improving with The Grim and the Grave which is set at an extremely fair price by pretty much any reasonable metric.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry Medieval Warfare is a very intense and frusterting game, yet it also happens to be the most rewarding and stimulating game I have ever played. It's best that I say it now. This game is completely dead even in it's review potential. Please allow me to explain...  1. Gameplay:   Gameplay is extremely well thought out and precise. To me, there is nothing more satisfying than shooting a Heavy Crossbow Bolt a hundred yards away into a Knight's neck. Or Being on the verge of death and managing to get that lucky stab with my dagger through an enemy's chest. The pacing is quite good and you are always on your toes. However, this game's precision also comes at a price. The way the weapons work in Chivalry is that as long as the weapon it'self hits you, it counts. This means that if I jump and do a 360 of of a bench and my sword hits you while spinning, you will get hurt. Most experienced players use this to their advantage. This results in new players being completely demolished and experienced players being nearly one-man batallions if they are good enough. This however also presents a learning curve. I came from Chivalry on the Xbox (We do not speak of that atrocity) and I was shocked at how people were playing. Twirling around and managing nearly impossible hits. BUT, if you take your time and are patient enough, you WILL learn how to counter-act these people. If not by Sword or Hammer, than by bow. Because what's the easiest way to take out a twirler before they hit you? Shoot 'em.   2. Community:  The comunity goes without the need for explanation, yet I will do so anyway. I have made SO MANY friends by playing this game. So many nice people who are funny, honorable, and just all around fun to play with. I personally haven't met anyone who hates me or vice versa, yet I have seen the ocassional jerk. I have seen a lot of kicks in my play-time, yet all of these people where either jerks themselves, causing a hostile enviorment (I.E. arguing with people in chat, spouting random insults, ect). The community loves to be helpful and most importantly to everyone, keep the game going. This means that if you are AFK for a while without telling anyone, they will most likely kick you in order for other people who are playing to join. Things like that. Yes, there will be jerks. They are on every game. But if you are light hearted and go in with good feelings and attitude, you will be surprised how many people that you never even knew will become your best friends.  3. Classes:   Each class is dynamic and unique in it's on way. Some out do others in stamina, others out do others in health, ect. But no class is better than the other. Examples; you may be a hulking Knight in full clad armor, but one good shot to the head from a Crossbow and you are done. You may also be a nimble and accurate archer, but if you are caught off guard or with your bow drawn, it's game over. Finally, you may be a Vanguard with a long Polearm, keeping enemies at a distance, but if someone gets through you with a dagger or short-sword, you are at a disadvantage. But what I like most about these classes is tht nothing is impenetrable. Any class can die by any class. A quick thing you will learn in this game is that Stats do not matter at all. Your weapon is only as good as the person weilding it. This means that if you are good enough, you can smash the face off of a Knight with a stick, or kill a Vanguard with well placed axe throwing. No class (Heh) Out-classes the other. Yes, I did a funny.  4. Servers:   There are many servers in this game. Each one is in a certain region or consist of certain mods, certain maps, ect. You will not have any issue finding what you want to play and where you want to play it. Although, make sure you keep an eye on your ping level to the right of the server names. Your peformance may varry on certain servers if you are not within your region, though, that is obvious.    So in conclusion....  1. There are really good players. Some of the tactics are cheap. But if you are patient enough to wait/learn/practice with others, you WILL match them and beat them.  2. There are good and bad people in the world. But a long as you aren't stiring up trouble, AFK without informing the others, or if your ping is too high, you will not be kicked.  3. Each and every class is hard to master. Very hard. But once you do, you can be very dangerous to anyone who crosses you. Also, people have a little disdain for archers. but those people are quickly silenced with a shot to the head! xP  4. Each and every server suits your needs in a particular need. There are so many, game modes, weapons, maps, and mods. Pick whichever fits your fancy.  So that's it. This review was to show anyone interested that this game DOES have it's pros and cons. Some will find it interesting and give it a try and love it. Others may do the same but find it lacking or not to thier liking. As long as you know what you are going in to, it's up to you what you do with the information given to you. I still however MUST recommend this game. For any Competitive, patient, medieval loving gamer out there, this game is NOT worth missing.  Thank you very much for reading.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Great game, endless multiplayer slasher fun!  Almost everything in chivalry is fantastic, theres something great about the whole experiance of cutting an opponents limb off and screaming 'FOR THE GLORY OF AGATHAAAA!' over his bloodied corpse.  The only downside to the game is the developers, torn banner, with every update they seem to break a critical game feature (Eg the entier ranking system being broken for a fair few months), which is a shame as it can make you stop playing the game for a long while and put you off it.  The only other annoyance is the community, often players can be very overly competative and immature, but i guess this is a given with most online games with lots of players.  Modes such as Duel and 3v3 battles are often much better in terms of players at they take a lot more patience and honour to play properly, i highly reccomend them.  My last point is to the learning curve of the game, there is a rank system to classify newer players from the more experianced, but due to the game having been out for a while, there are a lot of very good players which can put off newer players, however it is still often hard to have to take in scores of 3 kills to 30 deaths in a game, but its just down to practice.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"A persistant Online Game which Pits Hundreds of Players in 3 opposing factions against one another on huge land masses with their assortment of guns, tanks, planes, and troops all at one time. However it suffers from Latency Issues, Load problems, Faction and weapon balance, and most critically - Population Issues. While it is true that Hundreds of other players all connect to the same world you do, the square-footage to player ratio is so small that the game feels largely empty in spite of this fact.  And in the few instances where you actually find yourself fighting a sizable opposing force, the map grid you fight over is often no larger then the average Battlefield or Call of Duty Multiplayer map and usually lasts just as long as one of those maps as well because either you grossly outgun or outnumber them, or they grossly outgun or outnumber you.

265930,Goat Simulator,"Coffee Stain Studios has opted to take a break from their usual offerings of FPS/Tower Defense Hybrids to tackle the incredibly touchy and high bar genre of Farm Animal Sims.  You may ask if we truly need yet another goat simulation experience. With Maxis pretty much hitting it out of the park in the late 90′s with their PC classic: SimGoat. There were many poor attempts to cash in on the farm animal simulation craze of the era. Most notably were Goats! Goats! Goats! and Goat Herder Tycoon. However by the mid 2000′s the industry seemed to have milked that goat for all they could and turned their attentions towards farm machinery simulation.  Then out of nowhere came last year’s surprise hit: Goat Petting Simulator. Now the industry seems to be clamoring to get on the goat wagon once more. The first out of the gate of what will undoubtedly be a large herd of goats is none other than Coffee Stain Studio’s Goat Simulator. As you would expect from the well established genre, you are put in charge of a goat and must do goaty things.  There is the usual eating, licking, bleating, and jumping over things as you might expect from any goat sim. Also, with a modern graphics and physics engine we can experience the more destructive side of goats in full glorious 3d. Rag-doll physics are of course everywhere and you can get a little bit of glee as you watch your evil goat smash about.  There is also a lot of depth hidden here under the glossy surface. If your four legged fellah gets bored of his pen’s toys there’s plenty to explore and see. There is a nice, beautiful farm stretching off into the distance or your goat might fancy exploring the city. Like Goat Tycoon there are shops and such but there seems to be no sort of in-game economy. Lots of nice things to see in the store but no way to buy them. I was very disappointed there.  The game also tries to incorporate a quest system, like Goat Control. Although they are not clearly labeled there is plenty of things to do if you’re willing to explore and find it. Rise to the goat throne, summon aliens, rocket yourself off to space, or SACRIFICE THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT TO YOUR DARK GOAT GODS. Really they did a great job of coming up with so many little side quests and distractions. Some of them require a fair bit of planning as well, getting to space is especially hard, much harder even than Kerbel Space Program.  I must say though, mixing modern physics engines and graphics into Goat Simulation is quite a pleasant experience. The game is really well polished here and I’m quite amazed how well they pulled it off. There’s very few instances of objects clipping through walls or the goat suddenly spazzing out and rocketing up into the sky. There’s also a well done skater game style trick system that works really smoothly allowing you to land cool flips and such. Is that a person sticking out of a wall with their shadow left behind or modern art?  Is that a person sticking out of a wall with their shadow left behind or modern art?  Goat Simulator also does a great job of incorporating cool unlocks and add-ons. As you explore the world you will come across collectables here and there, some unlocking cool additions. Other add-ons are unlocked by completing some of the many quests, such as  SACRIFICING THE SOULS OF THE INNOCENT TO THE DARK GOAT GODS . This adds to an already lengthy game as you can play through again as a tall goat, a fast goat, or even a rocket powered goat!  I also thought the combat in the game seemed a little over powered. I mean   THE SOULS OF THE INNOCENT DO NOT OFFER ANY INKLING OF RESISTANCE  . And once you upgrade your goat with the baseball launcher, just forget about it. Game over. Nothing can stand in your way. It’s like a Michael Bay film and nothing will stop you as you blast everything in sight.  Overall though as I played and    UNLEASHED UTTER TERROR AND HELL UPON THE SOULS OF THE INNOCENT   , I couldn’t help but think this game just does not quite stack up to the old goat simulator classics of the late 90′s. Sure the graphics are shiny and there’s a nice new physics engine but the game just doesn’t bring anything new to the table. In the end you are just looking to set a new high score and I was very disappointed at a lack of multiplayer modes. The quests are cool and it’s fun trying out the different combinations of goat add-ons but did we really need another Goat Simulator? However if you’ve got $10 to spare I suppose you couldn’t do worse for a purchase on this April Fool’s Day.  Final Score: Graphics: 8/10 Game Play: 7/10 Music / Ambiance: 5/10 Story: 7/10 Value: 7/10 Overall: 6.8/10  Check out the full review with screenshots on my blog:  http://markofithian.com/review-goat-simulator/ ",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 is definitely a good game, but whether or not you think it's one of the all-time greats will probably depend on whether you play it or New Vegas first. If you played New Vegas first, Fallout 3 will initially be a little bit of a letdown. New Vegas is definitely the better designed game overall. Better game mechanics, more options, more nuanced, and better overall design. Fallout 3 can sometimes feel like a generic FPS, with all of the 'closed space, tons of enemies, just keep attacking dozens of times and repeatedly using stimpaks' design that you encounter in about a third of the map. That flaw doesn't really exist very much in New Vegas, so it can initially be offputting when you repeatedly encounter it in Fallout 3.  However, if you played Fallout 3 first, you'll probably think it's one of the greatest games ever made. It was the first Fallout game that really showed that 'wow' factor and hinted at just how great the franchise could be. Plus, you'll be really impressed by the one thing that Fallout 3 does better than New Vegas: emotion. In New Vegas, you are basically a mythic character, with little back story. You don't have that much in common with the NPC's, who are basically mere mortals while you are pre-destined to be a god. I mean, the game starts off with you shrugging off a point-blank shot to the head. The courier might as well come from a different planet than all of the NPC's.   In Fallout 3, however, you really get emotionally pulled into the game. You're just an ordinary person who takes it upon themself to do great things. Your whole backstory is very fleshed out, and pretty heartrending. Karma plays a much bigger role in this game than in New Vegas, and makes the playing experience that much more immersive. Family plays a huge role, as do genuinely good NPC's such as Three Dog. The emotional depth of Fallout 3 is some of the best you will ever encounter in a game. If you played New Vegas first, you won't even realize that emotional depth was missing. If you played Fallout 3 first, you will be disappointed by New Vegas' lack of emotional depth, despite the fact that New Vegas is superior in pretty much every other way.  In the end, you'll learn to appreciate each game for what it does best. You'll probably wind up preferring whichever one you played first, but you'll still really enjoy both of them. If you already have New Vegas and not Fallout 3, I definitely reccomend purchasing this, just be aware that you'll have to adjust your expectations a bit and look for different positives in this game than you found in New Vegas.  PS.- Be sure to adjust some of the game files after you install the game. Once you do, the game seldomly ever crashes. Until you do that, it crashes every few minutes.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I don't remember English and Japanese are the type of people always try to get max payment and do minium work, but somehow CA just turned into this after it was bought by Sega.  For so many years, CA didn't try to make decent siege battle. AI became slightly smarter, but I have seen people made better AI for Medieval II mod within few months.  Combat system has zero improvement, and even worse compare to that game they made 10 years ago.  I do not against adding health bar into total war game, but seeing a whole infantry get knocked down or send into air by calvery charge then they just stand up and beat the poop out of those knights makes me feel like being an idiot. Where is the anti charge animation?  By the way, it seems that CA didn't distinguish the difference between large units and calvery. It makes sense to have pikemen and halberdmen get bonus against knights because their weapon reach kept them safe while effective against men on the horses back, but why should giants care after all? Gaints‘s large clubs have the size of several men, and there is no pike or halberd long enought to touch their upper body yet in this game.   At last, all these features they added to force players to focus more on campaign did not make things more interesting nor realistic. Players buy Total War games for decent battles instead of manipulating agents and having armies fight automatically all time. Civilization, Crusader Kings did better job with campaign stratege.  Removing walls and limiting the armies player can recrut, and the attrition caused by Vampire corruption or the attrition for Vampire armies to enter uncorrupted provinces did not make things more interesting.",-1,0,0

Creates an anti cheat that automatically kicks and in some cases bans most high end players for legit play on new chars.  4.

Every time they try to fix or add anything they are just flailing around with their beating sticks hitting the reactor creating meltdown after meltdown. Combined with the extremely poor leadership of Smedley and some very poor choices from Higby (maxes are almost fine lol) until very reciently the game was simply doomed to ever be anything but a decent shooter turned mediocre by terrible vehicle/infantry relationships and a complete lack of using the larger scale of the game in a positive manner.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"I'm a little surprised at the overwhelming positive response Five Nights at Freddy's has gotten. I suppose I can understand it's entertaining at first glance, but a lot of the reviews I've read have play times mostly less than an hour or two, and some admit they didn't get further than Night 3, which is totally understandable, post-Night 3 was probably where the entertainment factor dropped off for me and the game became an exercise in tedium. And then I played it for 6 or 7 more hours just to try to finish the thing out of obligation. Anyways, let me get this out of the way:  The game is innovative. The reason it's gotten as popular as it has is because it's a fresh take on a genre that sadly has been dragging its feet lately. I'd absolutely love to see more Horror games try new things like this, and it's not bad that people are experimenting with new ways to convey interactive horror. I'm just as sick of seeing cheap-quality episodic Amnesia knock-offs and 'Collect-Items-While-Monster-Stalks-You' romps as anyone else, but I still have severe enough gripes with Five Nights that I really can't give it a recommendation for anything other than as a very temporary novelty.  If you intend on fully experiencing this game, prepare for the possibility of a good couple hours failing the same night over, and over, and over. Seriously the 9 hours I spent on this were mostly Nights 4, 5 and 6, I eventually gave up at 6 because I decided the payoff was seriously not worth my time.  As it turns out, Five Night's idea of using energy management to build tension just doesn't work in its favor in the long-term. Once you boil the game down to its base mechanics, all the charm falls away really quickly, because there's a pretty limited amount to see, a very limited amount to do, and the strict limit on how much energy you can afford to waste on the latter nights becomes unrealistically tight to the point where if you don't play almost perfectly to each situation, and the AI is uncharacteristically passive for its activity level at those later points, you are often destined to lose before you're a little more than halfway through the night.  There's not much more frustrating than fending off your aggressive attackers for 10 minutes straight, only to realize you've failed the night because Bonnie wouldn't leave the door alone, or because Foxy made a run for you twice because you weren't watching Pirate Cove enough, or watching it too much.  Read all the guides you want, learn all the animatronics' behaviors, that's what I tried to do once just winging it on my own wasn't working out, but Five Nights gets tough as ♥♥♥♥ by late-game, and intense difficulty in what should be a short overall playtime for the length of each night does not impact the horror aspect positively. A horror game does not flourish by treading over the same ground time and again, and that's essentially all that Five Nights can do once you've died a few times.  The more time you spend with the game, the more you understand, the less likely it'll have anything new to scare you with, and once you hit that point all you have left is frustration that you can't save enough energy to last a couple seconds longer to the safety of 6 AM.  Five Nights builds suspense very well, and its characters are fittingly creepy, but in the end it's always coming up to a couple different animations that play alongside the same exact sound clip with a different model shaking in your face. It loses its edge, and fast. Especially once you learn the tells, like if your wall panel stops working and you check your camera, or if Pirate Cove is empty and you check the West Hallway camera. You come to expect every death, and the only fear comes from how irritating and headache-inducing that damned screaming sound clip is.  If you're looking for anything more than a novelty, something to spook friends with once or twice, you may find Freddy &amp; Co. becoming a lot more frustrating than they ever were scary. However, if that's all you want, a quick little game to mess about with then uninstall and probably never play again, go for it. As for me, I've played enough of this thing to never really feel inclined to reinstall it. Also, it's getting a sequel? Come on...",-1,1,0

265930,Goat Simulator,"To be honest, I didn't play this game a lot. However, I have seen the thousands of Youtube videos showing it. I was almost forced to buy it from my friend, now it just sits in my library. I wasted 10 dollars on this thing.  It got repetitive and not fun. Yeah, it was funny, for the first 20 minutes. Don't forget the graphics are way to 'you need a beast computer or else the crappy one you have now will explode'-like. Especially for a game like this where it's taken as a joke. A 10 dollar joke. There is no gameplay value. You bump into random people and things, find trophies, find easter eggs, thats all you get.   I'm really sorry, buddy, but this game that you forced me to get isn't good. There were so many games that I could get and you could have gotten. Both of us wasted our money on this thing. You might think it's fun, I don't. You're entitled to your opinion and I'm entitled to mine. I sold my Strange Bushi-Dou for about 10 dollars and I regret spending any of it on this piece of crap. I could have spent it on other, cheaper, and better games.   Whoever has this on their wishlist, get it off. This game isn't worth it. See that 0.5 hours up there? That's all I needed to play to fully experience it. I could spend 1 hours, 2 hours, or even 10 hours playing and I would give the same review. Every minute it's the same thing. The same boring and dry comedy.  I know this review isn't the best as I'm not the best review giver, but this is my honest opinion. I've been pondering over this exact game and what it means to me and this is what came out my finger tips and on to the screen. I said it once, and I'll say it twice, this game is a 10 dollar joke. Not those comedian jokes that actually have the slightest bit of potential of being funny, but one of those jokes you see on a popsicle stick, until you throw the popsticle stick away.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,First: I like the style and the beautiful graphic design!  I am playing Total War Games since MTW 1 and I am a big fan of the series especially since mtw 2 introduced the multiplayer campaign. Multiplayer Campaigns never were the best designed mechanics in Total War Games but this time it´s horrible! I tried several campaigns with friends and the factor of unbalancing (also tried several mods to help balancing) is immense. Not only that the Game counts the provinces that both players have to determine the time to send in the chaos troops (the worst case was round 36 smashing the empire player to pieces) but also the scripted part that helps the single player to get some more income is missing entirely in multiplayer. Next problem are the diplomatic penalties that occur for playing coop with a friend. The only way way to play a multiplayer campaign is one player playing humies and the other the dawi and even is this case the balance is totally broken. The mod for playing both the same faction is a nice idea but if you are playing empire/balthasar you cannot use the offices for your generals. I could keep writing but I think there are too much problems to write them all down. By the way: If you play this campaign once (imagine the problems I described didnt´t exist) another game would be boring.  So my advice: If you want to play a great multiplayer campaign play Attila. This game is only for single Players who want to play a campaign in two or max three days and enjoy good graphics in battle. The strategic part is for 10 year old kids now. ,-1,1,0
265930,Goat Simulator,"In my opinion Goat Simulator is a huge advance in the technology used to create games at the current time. Yes there have been games like battlefield 4 with their physics engines, but with the engine used in goat simulator, Battlefield should really learn from Goat simulator to create games in the future. i was thinking like a DLC for Battlefield 4 when you are all goats and you have to fight to the death. I am almost certain that lots if not all people who have played the next-gen games would like to be a goat. i may not have played much of the great Goat simulator but i assure you that it is well worth your money. I think that people are too harsh on reviewing this game because of the fact that you are a goat. But they underestimate goats as a whole. If you think about it, without goats we would not have Frostbite 3, Titanfall, Hand cream and who can forget the wheel. The Wright Goats flying for the first time led to this game having jetpack goats. we humans think so much of ourselves and too little of the goats. So i ask you, not as a Goat supporter but as a fellow steam user and in some cases a friend. Give the goats a chance... Thank you.",1,0,1

Also - the vampires add a whole different playstyle and strategy to the game, which is really refreshing. Im guessing the orcs will be another dimension too..  p.s. This game is HARD :-) I tried 2 campaigns on vampires on hard mode and got killed both times! Had to revert to normal but still thats a real challenge too! Not for the faint-hearted.. :-)  Updated: The crashes have not been a big issue... had about 5 in total, and if you ask me - they are all related to graphic card overload (usually they happenin when im fielding many units in a battle and click on a spell or somethin that takes bit graphic power).. Simply followed the advice on forums etc to fix my crashes and seem to have mainly gone away..  Lovin' this game even more than when I wrote this review.. its actually pretty epic.. All the sh*t stuff that was in Rome/Attila is basically fixed (broken public order, broken AI, units dont route too easily etc..). The only thing they still need to fix is the constant skill pointing. But this game is basically what Rome II should have been.. and then some..! (had they not released Rome a year too early..!).

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 is a pioneer in the realm in both the genres of MMO and Military FPS. Set in the far future on the planet Auraxis, it pits 3 factions against one another in an eternal struggle for territorial dominance. You incarne a soldier off one of these 3 factions and thanks to the increbidible advancements in nanotechnologies, you have virtually unlimited lives, but so does your enemies. This results in a virtually endless fully PvP driven war.  What does this means in term of gameplay? Picture this, a typical server may host thousands of player at any given time and currently the battlefield consist of 4 huge maps, called continents. Said maps are dotted with dozens of bases each, some relatively small, others huge and all with a unique layout. However your objective on each base remains the same, to gain and maintain control over the one or multiple capture nodes, similar to a domination match in Call of Duty or the Conquest mode of Battlefield. It's actually closer to the Conquest style of Battlefield because the game features combined arms style warfare, including 5 basic classes of infantry, a heavy 7 ft tall mech suit for each faction, 5 different land vehicules, one of which is unique for each faction and 4 air vehicules, againt with 1 unique to each faction.  However, the game being an MMO, you will NOT (well rarely) have even fights in the style of classic FPS without some work. Sometimes you will join a group 200 strong to go capture a base that merely 10 people show up to defend and not even need to fire your gun once, other times would will be among the 10 dudes getting stomped by an army. And that doesn't sound really enjoyable now does it? No. The trick here is that you must use the map tool provided to you to find the good fights, would it be small skirmirshes or abosulety insane 200vs200 showdowns, you must learn to find these relatively fair encounters and stick to those. If you simply wander off at random, PS2 will not be a great experience.  Being an MMO, it would do you good to also find an outfit (called guild or clan in other games) to join so that you always have people to play with. It is exceedingly rare that a solo lone wolf player will be able to affect a battle with any degree of significance. Planetside 2 cares little for your K/D ratio. As a sniper you could kill 20 people and never die and still lose the fight because you ain't killing the medics reviving those 20 people you killed earlier, negating your efforts. Likewise an engineer who killed no one during and entire battle but kept his tank lines alive so THEY could kick some ♥♥♥ probably contributed more to a victory than the guy who picked off a few isolated kills. Planetside 2 is a game about logistics. In order to win a fight, you must bring at least a matching number of offenders to defenders and then manage to break the reinforcement lines of your enemy, usually by destroying key assests like Sunderers (Heavy transport vehicules that can be deployed as spawn points) or sieging the spawn rooms of a base.  When a side wins a battle can captures a base or succesfully defends one, they will naturally transition to going after the next base over and try to conquer it, at which point the losing side of the previous battle must muster their numbers again and try to defend that new objective. In a way, once you find a good fight, it's quite simple to keep following it wherever it evolves and keep enjoying your time with PS2. Following your outfit when they rally in numbers to execute a specific plan is also a good bet. In the worse cases, you can always click that 'join squad' button and deploy where the game thinks you'll find some action and it will give you a decent fight, most of the time.  As far as customization goes, it's fairly solid. The game gives you most of the basic, all around set ups you need to be effective and you can purchase additionnal weapons with more specialized roles later on. You can customize A LOT of stuff, from all of your infantry classes, mech suit and vehicules, to the implants you are using and the look of your character. There's a lot of functionnal and cosmetic upgrades. The gear you can get with in game currency you acquire as you fight or with real money. Mostly the cosmetic stuff is with real money only (They have got to make a buck some where I guess) My only beefs with the upgrades and customization are these : 1. It takes A LONG TIME to upgrade your account with in game earn credentials. The stuff is expensive! Gettting all of it for free will require you hundreds if not thousand of hours of play, so you better buckled down for a long treadmill ride. 2. While most of the gear you acquire could be considered sidegrades, like a gun that trades off the accuracy of your basic gun for a better rate of fire for example, some of the stuff you can eventually unlock is simply a plain upgrade over the basic gear. A good example would be the engineer's repair tool or the medic healing gun, which both have a series of linear upgrades that give them more range and faster revive/repairs. A guy with fully upgraded flak armor will take 50% less damage from explosion compared to the greenhorn who probably only just got the basic 10% one and so on and so on.  The end result is that people who paid more than you or played longer than you will have an edge until you catch up. It shows when a few newbies try to tackle even one experienced player, but it becomes nightmarish when a few newbies meet a few experienced players who better knowledge of the game, more practice, better teamwork AND well upgraded gear. Pro tip, you find high level players from your team? STICK WITH EM. Join their outfit too if they let you.  Technically the game at the time of writting this review works fine. Used to be very buggy and unplayable, but they fixed most of the bugs. You will however need a fairly decent PC to run this game. Nothing too extravagant, but do not expect an 8 year old machine to run this game. Big fights become notoriously CPU demanding So I would invest in a modern CPU, at least a decent i5 or you will have to skip the title entirely.  However for those who can cope with the specs requirement, the F2P grind and the challenge of learning how to find the good fights, Planetside 2 will reward them with a very competent and enjoyable Massive Multiplayer First Person Shooter Futuristic War Simulator. That's a long list of barriers to entry I understand, but at least you can try it out for free. Give it at least 5-10 hours before you decide. You might get hooked for one hell of a ride.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a great game, easy to get into and very, very, very hard to master. Actually that's a lie. It's IMPOSSIBLE to master. It by itself is a great game, with tons of chareacters as well as a variety of arcade gamemodes. It's main gamemode is a competitve team battle, for the competitive gamer. The only things that could be looked down in my short time of playing are these; the game is not very open to the noob who doesn't really try to get better, just kinda sticks to the basics. To me that is good, as only players who have the drive to get better will really enjoy the game. That said, some people will view this as a bad thing, mainly because either they are that player or they feel that everyone should be included. There are better arguments out there to support this being a bad thing, but none I can presently remember. The other problem is the extremely salty community. A lot of dota 2 players that I've seen jump at the chance to criticize people worse than them and blame a lost game on them. That isn't to say that all players are that way, I've met some pretty nice dota 2 players who are competitive and aren't that salty. There are also times when it is completely reasonable to blame someone, like if that someone is throwing a game or just fooling around. But, a lot of the time dota 2 players are unjust in their criticism, like blaming first time noobs and players who are not playing at their fullest.

570,Dota 2,"Now, I haven't played this game for long, and i've neglected it since I first found out of it's exsistance a couple years ago, but this game is really fun. Many, many heroes to choose from, each with their own distinct abilites. It's insane fun. The community is mostly good, some bad apples here and there, but I cannot reccommend this game for one sole reason; the punishment system.  Now I live out in the country side, and my internet is pretty good most days, but there will be a day or two where it will be so bad, I will lose internet for a good few minutes. Now when i'm playing DOTA and that happens, that really ticks me off. I lose connection, i'm kicked from the game and given a penalty, having to play specific amount of single-draft games before I can play regularly. This pisses me off, and I think for a good reason. I can see why it would deter people from playing, and I don't blame them.  So for all of you out there with questionable internet, I advise you to stay away from this game, unless you enjoy having the urge to find the nearest puppy and kick it. Valve, if you read this, please, PLEASE, remove this punishment crap from the game. TF2 doesn't have this problem, but I understand why you think punishing people from a game like this might be acceptable, but try to consider those whose internet is that of sticking my ethernet cord into a potato. But yeah, Valve, fix your crap.",-1,0,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Just play ♥♥♥♥ing cookie clicker, seriously. This game is ♥♥♥♥. There is NO reason to play this game instead of cookie clicker. The art style, uninspired, generic, boring. You stare at a square and watch generic enemies die and immediately get replaced. SO ENGAGING. With Cookie Clicker you have a theme, yes it varied to things that didnt produce cookies eventually, but heres the thing, that was a JOKE, and it got more and more extreme. This just does whatever it wants, its not funny, the descriptions and names arent clever, its just oh hey heres an upgrade.  Seriously, theres assassins, Betty Crocker, and a tree monster. Its not even consistantly more absurd it gets more and less unreasonable as it wants. In cookie Clicker, the upgrades were funny, in here, they're upgrades. Cookie clicker was something subtly clever that had a feeling of actual structure and progression, it knew what it wanted to be about and where it was going, from cookies to eltritch gods.   It doesnt even have all the features cookie clicker has, Theres no wrinklers, Golden Cookies, no text on the top telling clever jokes, nothing. The only new feature is a line of unlockable abilities like this is ♥♥♥♥ing WoW and its far less interesting. It ***MAY*** have a ripoff of Cookie Clickers presiege system with heavenly chips and such, but as far as I can tell that wont be of much value, and frankly its not worth your time to get there.  Everyone saying that you'll break your mouse is an idiot, everyone knows clicking stops being useful in cookie clicker relatively quickly. The art styles generic, theres no theme or humor (at best theres an enemy that looks almost lawsuit levels of similar to TMNT, and something about one of the upgradable characters holding back) by the way, it doesnt give you like buildings or troops to ramp up absurdity, it gives you some random character of some random proffesion, soon to become obsolete, but they do occasionally have an upgrade that buffs everyone, at least Cookie Clicker had something to keep your cursors useful, buffing theme for every building you have, this doesnt have something like that.  The most insulting thing really is that they put microtransactions into this low effort ripoff, not even the sound effects or music have the slightest bit of originality, just play ♥♥♥♥ing Cookie Clicker, Candy Box 1 or 2, or A Dark Room, and if you want music listen to your own damn music. Hot tip devs, what do Cookie Clicker, Candy Box, and Dark Room have that you DONT.  One, some ♥♥♥♥ing charm, they all have something unique and interesting about them other than just idling and occasionally ♥♥♥♥ing with them, from hidden game mechanics to jokes and wit, to hidden lore and progression to the absurd. Also, some MEANINGFUL progression Cookie Clicker shows you what youve accumulated, and grows, Candy Box expands far beyond what you'd ever expect, Dark Room adds some new tricks, expands, and gives you a twist that those who werent paying attention would never expect. This game is shallow, ininspired, cripplingly lacking in charm, and just ♥♥♥♥ing generic and soulless.  Did you know Cookie Clickers still being developed, yeah the guy didnt abandon it despite its 15 minutes of fame being over, its come a long way, and its far more inspired and charming than this. Also A Dark Room and Candy Box while being a bit different still have a charm and soul to them that this game simply cant have. Wanna know WHY? People say that when art ceases to be about art they mean it doesnt exist because the art itself is its reason to exist, it stops being about something that deserves to exist and be created because its just to good to let fade into the void. When you create something new, you get something new, when you make something to spread a message, you wont learn anything but the message you forced in and cease to learn or grow from it, when its about money, you cut corners and refuse risks and shamelessly rip off the work someone else has made because you dont care about creation enough to make something ♥♥♥♥ing interesting, in short, no, this games not interesting, this isnt a a good idle game, it has no charm, it has no soul, and despite being free it still feels either made for a quick buck, an amature product made for practice that was uploaded to steam because why not, or some blend of the 2, its not worth your time.",-1,1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 was amazing. Was. The beta and alpha releases were spectacular. The different races were balanced, the different weapons were balanced and there was no 'Tactic to Rule Them All' because for each combat style there was an effective counter.  The game looked amazing, and handled like it too. Shiny graphics in decent frames even on my average computer. (GTX 560, 3.2Ghz core.)  Then about one or two weeks after came the first patch, and I'm not entirely sure what SOE was aiming at, but it literally broke the game engine. From being able to run the game at a ~70 FPS on high/highest graphics, after the 'patch' was installed my computer could barely start it up. It became a personal war on .dll files to even be able to play the game. This was the first graphical improvement patch that SOE released. This was apparently the kind of work that SOE considered an improvement.  They then went on to 'improve' the game balance by ruining the class weapons for one race while buffing the same class on another to the point it was the only one worth using. (Example: The Vanu MAX anti-air guns became more useful for shooting infantry with than that class' anti-infantry guns which got nerfed into the ground. The NC MAX anti-infantry shotguns became so powerful they could be used to destroy light vehicles at 200 yards.)  And you might ask: 'But the alpha and all that happened ages ago, and there have been many updates and improvements since.'  And I ask in turn: Do you think those improvements are deemed as such by you as a player, or by SOE? The team who within a month of release had managed to destroy their own game by trying to make it better? It's true that they released the Roadmap system to try and combat their own incompetence, but it was too little too late and it's not exactly something they have followed anyway.  In short, do not recommend. It's a weird situation where I say that the alpha and even the beta were better than the current release. If you want a sci-fi multiplayer combat game, try one of the Star Wars Battlefront games instead.",-1,0,0

My game crashes after every match on MP and as I searched there's NO SOLUTION.  2. For a week I was not able to join any game and got stuck on the finding lobby. I have no idea how I solved it. All other games/programs and Uplay games where working ok.  3. I lost all my save games and I couldn’t use a download save game because they are encrypted with your Uplay username. So you cannot use any other save game different from yours. And no, there's no actual way to decrypt the. For the version 1.04 there a tool called FC3 Save Helper.  4. I had an FPS issue and I don't know why. On my GTX590 I was getting 20-30 FPS. Now I'm getting 50-75 (Refresh limit).  5. My friends cannot join to my CO-OP games and I can't join to their games.

You 'die' too much in the story. I stopped counting at the 4th attempt on my life by Vaas. I am not done iwth the game yet but I think the writers went a bit overboard with the number of times people kill you in the story and yet somehow you miraculously survive. Not a game breaker though.  2. Your character 'Jason' falls deeper and deeper into complete bada**ness as the game progresses. This is awesome. However, I think they fell short on the voice acting here. His voice throughout still sounds pretty innocent and clueless. I would have preferred the actor put some more ...'growl' in it as he becomes more jaded with life. Again, not a game breaker.   I would recommend this game for sure. The combat is solid, the jungle is beautiful (but sadly not as flamable as the dry plains in FC2), and the finishing moves are awesome.",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Note this review is very strict :P .  Planetside 2 review  I USED to like the game , now I dont. I stopped playing about 3 months since March 2014 and came back during the Hossin Continent update, in hopes of a more fun and balanced gameplay. But it dissapointed me on so many levels. I was rusty when I came back but none the less I still remember the core mechanics and how to point and shoot. I played a few hours and died a lot, but its was to be expected after 3 months of leaving the game. About 15 hours in and not only my PPH (points per hour) was still drop to a measely 500/hr but my kill death ratio per game was more or less 0.2 to 0.1, not that I'm complaining since I'm an objective based player, but there is a lot of scenarios that I would have gotten a kill and survived with heavy injuries, but still alive before this update rolled out.  The changes are noticeble, infantry shield and hp was lowered , especially noticeble on the MAX suits , weapon damage was also changed for some of them. Some of the utility or special abilities of the class was changed in term of drain/ cooldown/ effect/ power , making a significant improvement in 1 of the classes but a significant drawback for the other. Graphics wise, it still looks the same but something has been change and is eating up my pc's power. Vehicles have been change as well and their weapons as well, mostly buffed. The point system is overall the same , that or slightly better. The deathcam has been improve I guess , but only slightly. The Hossin map is still under testing phase so the constant infantry and vehicles stuck are neglible and the map itself is good , thought that area lacks people playing. The teamwork of the game have mostly been lost , and objective based gameplay is pretty non-existent , most players now just care about their kill death ratio. The factions itself is now very unbalnced as well , it was about 30% TR , 30% NC , 40% VS when I last played , now its around 60% TR 30% NC and 10% VS. Now right now I maybe sound like some VS supporter, but mind you I play as all 3 factions and my favourite is TR because of their increased firerate and magazine size. But now the factions dominance is so unbalanced it's almost impossible for other minority to recover some of their bases. TR can fight on 3 front of the continent and win 2 of them, while the rest fight on the remaining continent barely making progress. As usual SOE still kept their currency at a decent price not too high and not too low. But the charge for most of the in game item is still expensive and the progress of getting cert ( the games earnable currency ) is still very bad grinding no matter how good you are.   This is what gets me now, for all games I review based on 10 main things, the New user experience, the casual player experience, the experienced player experience, music , art style (or graphics) , price ( in this case in game microtransation items ) , progress (if the game has any) , its main theme ( multiplayer , single player , story telling , etc ) , its community , and last but not least , the MOST important thing for games, whether you are satisfied playing the game or completely hated it or mutual ( short version : fun or not).  New user (1 to 10 lvls) : Worst than before, the shield and hp system is very weak for the new user and hence they will die a lot faster and their starter weapons are not as good as they used to be.  Casual players (5 to 40 lvls) : Overall not much has changed based on what I seen , you can play normally without getting 1 shotted most of the time and an advantage will normally guarantee your 1v1 scenarios.  Experience players (41 and beyond) : Pretty much has all the infantry stuff mastered (not sure about vehicles ecause gameplay choices) , has very good gear that can overpower most low level enemy players and a very upgrade suit.  Music : Hasnt changed from what Iheard from the 3 factions, them songs is still the same I believe with TR a bit sadistic , VS and bit weird and alien like, and NC as um... western texas type of music. Weapons sounds have been change and is sounds much better now.  Graphics : No comment other than cant see cloaked inflitators while using low settings.  Price : Free but in game microtransactions are a tad bit high  Progress : Utterly slow at all levels unless you become a member, then you have a score system that actually means nothing when you think about it, cert gain is a pain as mentioned before ( exp 30 certs for a scope and 250 score pts to get 1 cert pts, so around 7500 score points to get just 1 scope) as for weapons, even longer as anyone would expect.  Main theme : It should be a competitive multiplayer on a very very very large scale. It does that well at the start but because of the unbalnced faction, its not like that anymore, you either win or lose with a landslide on the normal to large scale battles (not accounting for the 4v4 base atk and def, cuz that's not large scale :P)  Community : I chatted with the players in game, allies and enemies, visited the forums, overall quite good for a shooter, much much better than Call of Duty's community.  Fun or not: As of the Hossin update no, unless you are leveled with decent suit upgrades and weapons, new users will get destroyed no matter what, even then the unbalanced faction wars couple with slow progress makkes the game a pain to play, statistically the weapons arent overpowered when compared with the dafault ones, but when you play, you will notice that its very different in comparison. For the paid or the one with the heart to grind throught everything, its an enjoyable experience. At the based level we all deserve a free to play game that is fun right from the start, not after paying over 60USD or grinding 800 hours into the game.  Serious Score: 47. 67 % (Note: decimals dont mean anything) Normal Score: 63. 54 % dropped as of Hossin Update",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"First I want to say how much I have enjoyed this game. It is a great game. The Total War gameplay has come a long way, and it is very impressive. However, I cannot say that I can recommend this game. In comparison to other Total War franchises, the content isn't bad. The problems I have with the game are more related to the lack of Warhammer content. I had chose to wait to write this review hoping that they would release the missing races/factions as free DLC. Man was I wrong. While I got the Chaos Warriors for free as a preorder bonus, anyone else is going to have to purchase these guys at $8. Then, if you want to actually see blood effects, decapitation, etc, you are out another $3. Come on Sega. That's crap. This is a war game, that stuff should be included. I said to myself, 'Lets wait it out and see'. Nope. I was still wrong. Now, starting 7/28/16, you can pay another $18 to buy the Beastmen(A race that should have been included to begin with). I know that sega is prob still in the hole to creative assembly and is using these DLC to pay for it, but I am serious when I say do not waste your money on this game. Do not even pay 50%. Because you will end up spending at least another $30 in an attempt to complete this game. Be forwarned, they will release another race for this at more rediculous pricing.

A lot of people seem to be uncomfortable with the union of Total War and Warhammer game play and lore, but, I have found it to be a breath of fresh air in the Total War collection. The biggest complaint is that you cannot conquer every territory and to that I say... so what? Each nation has specific victory objectives that have nothing to do with those territories and it keeps the end game interesting because you cannot neatly shield in your empire without having these little gaps for the AI to sneak into, even if you have razed the province.  Which brings me to the biggest con, the AI is not great. Battle AI is fine but the campaign AI leaves much to be desired. Why is it that by turn 93 the Vampire counts have not taken a single territory?? Playing as the Counts you can easily unify Sylvania in a few turns... WTF? The only region that seems to actually expand are the Greenskins and I am starting to believe it is only due to the fact that they are blessed with the Waaaagh! and can throw their might around without any real strategy like a noob…  There does seem to be a great deal of balancing issues and many graphics problems and even spelling mistakes in game (and no I am not talking about armour and the like) how about “wielding an az” WTF is an az? Last I checked “az” is a Dwarf word for place. So the Dwarf soldiers wield a mighty place?  Most of the things that frustrate me about this game a product of present game manufacturing: Rush to launch with a great idea and bank on massive patches and updates to fix all of the things you weren’t willing to devote the resources to earlier on.

Everything will seem hunkey dorey. Then, if you made it to phase two, you will advance to RANKED matches. Once you get to ranked, you will notice things.  Your team always seems to suck. Your team always seems to blame you for their shortcomings. When you call mid, put your token on mid, and lock in a mid character, two other teammates will do the same after you. When you have a stable mid going, teammates will wander over and stand around taking your farm under the pretence of 'ganking'. When you have a nice safelane, you will suddenly be jarred from farming as the pudge with a 3 level advantage hooks you out, because your mid was too busy to call missing and your supports too busy rushing aghanims to buy wards. When you die, and had a controversial pick, your team will immediately report you and tll you they did so. For good measure they will probably throw in a few 'noob unistal doto' and 'noob stahp fed'.

Team objective is full of teamates killing you/putting you out of the fight. And the overall combat is just a bunch of ice skaters swinging weapons around that will one shot you. 10/10,-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I have't played Planetside 2 (PS2) in months, but I'll write from what I remember. PS2 is very zergy. Fights are boring stalemates among a a couple a of bases that don't move for hours or possibly days. Also, random, unneeded nerfs are the norm with this game. Go to the official forums and you'll see a lot of threads whiny people calling for nerfs for little to no reason. The devs also seem very apathetic to the game and make very little to no new content besides random guns, camos, and other cosmentics. Also the maps are rather boring and lifeless. They lack functionality and despite their size, most of the time you'll being playing arena deathmatches in bases or just sitting your spawn room while the enemy bombards it. Vehicles are made of tissue paper and hit like tennis balls while infantry just demolishes them, thus making vehicle play far more on the useless side. This game is very grindy and the grind is pratically the only point to it. There's no real interesting goals or anything for long term play, just grinding and killwh*ring. There's far more bad things I could say, but I'll start to wrap this up. This game is basically a mind numbing and boring slog with little point. The large battles are rather poor and unimpressive. Honsetly, if you want to try out a good game witht this IP or sci-fi like MMOFPS, there's always the first Planetside at here:  https://launch.soe.com/installer/PS_setup.exe , but that's a hacker ridden and dead game. To me it's just far better than this POS. This review could be more me being ultra jaded on this game and me realizing that Planetside 1 is FAR better. but my opinion stands. Avoid this game completely. Your valuable time and money are better spent somewhere else. This game's major gimmick of large battles is not worth taking an intellectual dump and wasting anything of value of yours on it. This is a fundamentally f*cked up game with an identity crisis, and in my experience, games with an identity crisis suck.",-1,0,0

After this mandatory pre-beta Reborn download it's just been downhill, hit rockbottom and kept digging. After every update, it just gets worse.   I'm fine with cinks and bugs, I freely participate in Beta releases like Hots, Reborn, Windows 10 etc. It's not the bugs, it's all these changes, that has made me hesitate to double-click the Dota icon for me. After 700+ hours Dota takes away levels and gives me an icon that changes when I level up. Great but now the one match I'm playing with people with 1000+ hours and it's how Dota always was. Next, a match with people who don't even have a steam profile yet. The experience mmr bracket is ruined by the new levelling system incorporated into this chaos.  The T5I is over and the compendium rewards are STILL buffering. We were supposed to get them easily 4-5 months ago. 'There have been compatibility issues regarding the desert terrain and the axe immortal is still being made', fine you're busy, but then why rush a pre-beta then and release several treasury items when we're still waiting for what we paid for since the beginning of 2015?  I'm not saying it's a horrible game, I'm saying it's not what it was and I don't like the direction it's going into. It changed too much too quickly, it's missing several key factors that is being pushed aside for the illusion of progress.

265930,Goat Simulator,"My nominee for 'Best us of a Farm Animal' award 2016 - and may god have mercy on me for it.  The developers say so right in the description on the store page, this is a waste of your money...well they're right. It manages to be fun in 20 minute increments before becoming boring. Some time later it may interest you again, but the interest wears off quickly. Still, I can say I've had way more fun playing this game than I should.  This game is a packaged asset flip using free assets, bought assets, donated assets, and dropped together in a physics sandbox consisting of a handful of maps where you, a goat who breaks everything you crash into, run around smashing things into other things until unexpected stuff happens which makes you laugh. Usually these things involve explosions, you flying through the sky, fire, cars, building collapses, and whatever else you may not immediately think of. If you are the kind of person who goes, 'I wonder what will happen if I toss x at y,' you will be well served by this game.  The gameplay gets no more complicated than that, there are weird things to find across the map which change up how you make stuff crash into other stuff, but nothing gets more involved than running around a map creatively breaking things.  Goat Simulator is what it is. It doesn't try to be more than it advertises, and that may be its best strength. The quality is far higher than any one-note-joke you can download for free, but a quality one-note-joke wears out as quickly as a cheap one. I don't regret my purchase and I've had more fun in this game than I probably should have, but I will say your money is better spent elsewhere.",-1,0,0

When the Blood for the bood god Dlc came out, I was joyful imaginging that this will be like the novels. I am unsure on what the DLC is like because the game keeps crashing when its loads up. I tried various other methods and even bought a new laptop, to no avail. this problem has persisted for over a month, and most other gamers have had this same problem.  the game mechanics are great, it works like rome 2 but with some vast improvements, but you will only get 4 races if you start with no Chaos Dlc, and there are over a dozen races in this games universe.

265930,Goat Simulator,"FULL REVIEW: I love this game so much. The fact that you can bring down a full gas station is enormously funny, plus the fact that every time you blow up a car by headbutting it, the explosion sends you majesticly careening into the air, which is twice as good in slow motion to watch. I also love that the game has a workshop to download even more things to make the game better and ultimately extend the hours that you play the game. To me, every hour is worth it. I love how this game has really funny AI to where if the ragdoll, it's over for them, and you can them lick them and drag them around, which is hilarious to watch and listen to the person you have captive. Plus, I love the ring of goats where you can fight the goats, and the challenge is always pushing you to try again, unless you're easily frustrated. The game has many other funny things that I enjoy as well, like the AI in the Coffee Stain Studios building flying into a wall and still typing, or really any AI getting stuck in a wall to the point where they have a seizure. The goat though, I have not yet adressed. The goat constantly has a tongue hanging from its mouth like a dog, and the neck the goat has is so glitchy that sometimes when you headbutt something the neck extends to the point that a giraffe doesn't look very awkward, and the head flys upward along with the head. No, the neck doesn't go very smoothly either. It spazzes before it flies. Not to mention, if you headbutt something explosive, such as a gas tank or a propane tank, your character literally flies. One thing I didn't address was that it has a spazfest before it begins to majestically fly. The baa button is also very clever. You could press the button once and it would let out a normal baa. But sometimes if you press the button, the  goat lets out a banshee-like scream, adding to the hilarity of the game. What's nice about the developers is that they listened to their fans, and they made a MMO mode, which I have not yet had the chance to experience, but from what I've heard and seen, it also looks as great. Which goes to show Coffee Stain Studios does infact listen when their fans speak, unlike most other game developing companies, indie or not. Now you noticed that at the beginning of my review I didn't go into any detail about the workshop. So as my final thing to address on this game is the workshop. The workshop allows you to download what are essentially mods for the game, whether it be a horror map, which function quite well if enough time is put into them, or a skin for the goat, which can turn out hilariously wrong. What is nice about the ability to download different maps is that you can use your imagination and do literally whatever you can within the already widened parameters of the game itself.    FINAL VERDICT: Goat Simulator is a very enjoyable game to play, as I have played past the point of a day, and nearly to the point of 2 days, and every second has been thoroughly enjoyable enjoyable. I could not find one thing bad about this game whatsoever, and thus Coffee Stain's Indie game Goat Simulator earns a perfect score of 10/10!",1,0,1

Literately, the mmo dlc was great and the day z dlc was awful. Don't buy it, play it with a friend on their acount, or wait 'til it's all on sale.

Otherwise sod it  --------------------------  Let's be serious now.  I am not the type to chicken out at the sight of a little competition, but this is ridiculous, and no self-respecting human being should have to subject themselves to having to perform sly, underhanded trickery tantamount to hacking in order to win in a (BEEP)ing video game.  I HAVE had legitimate duels with skilled players who didn't 'drag' or feint, and it is some of the most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game.  However, In the last 75-100 hours of play I've probably had less than 50 of those.  But let's not blame the community for everything, after all, the developers could have easily fixed these problems, and if they had this game would no doubt still be extremely popular.  If they had fixed these issues. if they gave a flying (BEEP) about their game, it would most likely still have the excellent, funny, chivalrous community I fell in love with 2 years ago.

570,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a great game, at least for the FIRST COUPLE HOURS (yes in caps). The most terrible thing in this game is the community. They swear at you for no reason or for just some small mistakes that will not have a big effect on the entire match (i.e not denying a creep when playing a support. And that was only one creep). Or sometimes you get cussed by a person because of the person's own mistake (i.e A lvl 2 Faceless void rush to the enemy tower to chase an enemy hero with 40 HP left, and then the void dies while the chased doesn't. The void curse at Rubick, his/her laning partner for not giving a heal) it's like messed up. Or sometimes you can also find people being racist. I personally stop playing public matches for like 4 month and I only play againts bots (because they don't curse at you). In a month period (perhaps), maybe i'll just stop playing Dota. Unless some miracle or something unexpected happen. And the chance for those event to happen is like 0.01%  I definitely don't recommend this game (I myself actually regret dowloading this)",-1,0,0

Also be prepared for salty players to call you out for being bad despite feeding themselves. This game reveals the worst elements of human nature when whiny f*ckboys who are insecure blame you for their own mistakes, and also be preapred to constatnly mess up yourself because this game takes forever to get good at.

The player has very little actual control and a lot is left up to random chance. Just about the only feedback the game provides the player with is jumpscares. Winning a level doesn't feel rewarding at all.  The best way to win this game is by refusing to play. You can then construct the lore of an employee of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza suing the owner for wreckless endangerment after Night One, making millions of dollars in the resulting media fallout and cheesy horror movie series deal.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I'll start with the positive: the battles look amazing. It's fun to watch the different units tear into each other, if you are willing to wait until you actually encounter another race (which takes a while as the empire or vampire counts.) The negative, for me, is the departure from total war. The economy in this game is completely awful. I agree with another reviewer who said they just added in background income to try to fix it. There is no point in building economic buildings, since they give so little income. This means you can't field multiple armies, just one or two. When the Chaos warriors arrive, you basically get to set there and defend, in battle after battle, with no hope of expansion. You are never able to autoresolve. The vampire counts v humans &amp; greenskins v dwarves combined with quest battles take out a lot of the create-your own stratgey, snadbox feel and gives the game a linear progession.

The recent changes have deffinitly destroyed the game and the base of its ideas! Heroes like Zeus have allready had a very balanced and fixed position in the game! You could buy supportativ items to be used in skillful ways to gain and advantage! (forcestaff, veil of discord, blink dagger and so on)  Nowadays you simply buy a lens and a lotus and rek everything cause you have extra cast range and increased dmg output... Making this game a sad copy of League of legends where you can also carry with a freaking caster! This was never intended to be like this...  Everything in this game feels incredibly imbalanced atm!

NO game should release any let alone 3 pieces of DLC 2 months after launch   As for the game itself, the map feels smaller than others in total war mostly due to fact you are limited to where you can conquer, mods fix this but its not like previous TW games where you fight a variety of nations. In warhamer TW you fight 5 : bretonnia who are unplayable empire, dwarfs, orcs, vampire counts,  chaos who you have to pay for unless you preordered   they have differnet names ie middehaim and nordland etc.. but have exact same roster and are indiguishable from one another  -mechanics arent anything innotive if anything its a step back -combat isnt anything special -campaign doesnt feel the same as other TW campaigns alot more linear ie, unify faction, defeat factions main enemy and defeat chaos    All in all a waste of £40 which only got me part of a game",-1,0,0

While Goat Simulator is a nice relatively simple game, it's just that, an overall relatively simple game. It's not like a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'simulators' that try to cash in on Goat Simulator's success. It's also not like the really well thought out simulators, like Bus Simulator or such.   It's hard to really describe Goat simulator. You're a goat, you run around and do anything you want. You have bad animation, but you rarely look at the goat itself. There's even a skate board ramp at one point, only thing is you don't 'Skate' you just ragdoll your body and throw it around, and yet it works.   I don't know if I'd heavily recommend this game, because it feels unpolished at almost any angle, the animation of the goat is weak, and the 'game' is... well I don't know if there's really a game.   But it's still wicked fun to go run around the level and act like an animal.  If you have a couple guys over and want to just have a blast, the local co-op actually works quite well.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Mix of RPG and FPS, only the roleplaying and the shooting sucks hard. Character creation is a joke: stats have minimal impact on gameplay, skills too easily and too quickly max out, and most perks just boringly add skill points... every character inevitably turns out the same and hits max level before finishing the base game. Some skills were borderline pointless as was food, drinks, and drugs in general. The dialogue system is shallow and choices, if any, are limited and rarely have meaningful or satisfying consequences. There are not enough interesting towns to visit, Megaton was the only area that felt semi-complete, other settlements only consisted of a few buildings and useless people, none which felt the least bit believable. Moira in Megaton is one of the worst written characters in video game history and a shining example that Bethesda doesn't understand Fallout humor. Similarly, the vampires and treeminders should have stayed out of Fallout 3 and remained on Oblivion's cutting room floor. The weapons, especially energy weapons, were incredibly lacking and combat outside of VATS was deplorable. The storyline was terrible, the world was bland, there weren't enough sidequests to stay interesting, and voice acting was terrible. Navigating DC was just a pain and the maps were terribly unhelpful. With all that said, the game did do a good job of making killing feral ghouls in a dark cellar effectively spooky. This game is not deserving of the Fallout name, nor do I believe it is a good game in general, how people seemed impressed by its rampant mediocrity I'll never understand.

Great physics on unit collision. + Great soundtrack + The 6 possible factions you can play all feel unique and very different. + Graphics are impressive.  - This game still needs to be optimized for Nvidia gpu's.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry has an extremely intuitive melee combat system that is totally destroyed by hitboxes. A standard slash can somehow manage to hit people directly to your right and left, and 1st person mode does an awful job of portraying whether or not an attack hit.  Lag in this game is so bad. Even with my 'maximum ping' at 50, that doesn't guarantee the server you join that has 47 ping isn't gonna be full of people with 300+ ping that jitter around and win every fight.  There's 2 game-types, team deathmatch, and free-for-all. Truthfully, there are more than that, but they are literally unplayable. Objective based maps are plagued with utterly useless players who are either AFK or just sprint into every fight and team-kill you, swinging their sword around like they were trying to hit a bee. Not only that, but most objective based matches are filled with people who somehow don't know what to do, despite large objective markers and a constant objective box.   The community is literal cancer. Taunt spamming, borderline immature arguements, and people with twice as many deaths as kills telling you that you suck balls plague the chat 24/7.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"There are only a few medievil-themed FPS games out there, but I would recommend any of the other ones above this one. This has to be one of the most laughably-bad games I have ever played. I have a good ping, my net connection might not always be the most STABLE mind you, but when it's up it is SOLID. Yet it doesn't really matter in this game, as often when I join a server, even those listed as East Coast Official servers, my ping is the only one below a 100, and most are well above that. I joined a US server once where everyone had a 200 or higher. I think by now everyone knows WHY this is bad for a competitive online multiplayer game, but in Chivalry it gets even worse...even with zero latency issues between you and your opponent, aim and where the weapon will strike have very little to do with one another. I've played War of the Roses pretty extensively, so I had an inkling of how the combat in this game would pan out, but NOTHING I aimed ever hit where it was supposed to. I often just swung randomly out of frustration, and ironically this is where I got most of my kills. There were also several players I met, all wearing custom skins, who just seemed absolutely unkillable. They would obliterate you with 1 hit blocking or not, yet any counter-attack on your part was shrugged aside, and didn't even break their swing, and as with WotR 2-handed swords are definitely the be-all, end-all of this game, unless you are a ping exploiter and prefer the fast-swinging hammers that often kill you in a fit of lag and leave you staring at a red screen going 'wha?'. More than once I was killed by someone I had swung at before they even reacted to me, only to instead be killed by them as they phased through me and attacked my shadow.  All in all, the hit-detection and serious, SERIOUS latency issues, both of the game and the player-base, make this a joke of a game at-best to me. The best thing I can say about it is that a game hasn't made me laugh this hard in a LONG time.  Which is unfortunate, as I'm pretty sure that is not the intent of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"With a huge open world to explore and many intelligent and ruthless enemies (including the local wildlife) to make that exploration difficult, Far Cry 3 has many many hours of entertainment and satisfying gunplay to get absorbed in. The day/night cycle, the beautiful islands and the effects from the array of weaponry are all a fantastic sight. The satisfaction to be had from 'liberating' an outpost by stealthily doing some recon and tagging all the soldiers before picking them off one by one is equally as much fun as doing it the less subtle way. Enemy AI is intelligent enough to not make it that easy for you to just run off in to the woods and hope they leave you alone, making for some very intense moments waiting for them to step on the tiger instead of you.  The slight disappointment with this game was the main story. At times dark and sombre, at others just downright strange, and with the odd moment of humour it was as though the game didn't quite know what it wanted to be. It was fun, and the hunt for the psychopathic Vaas has some fantastic character portrayal to keep you entertained but the whole thing culminates in a somewhat unsatisfying ending, leaving you to wonder what the hell just happened. You're left to scrambling around the islands to mop up the side missions and do the grind of finding relics and other inconsequential items. Overall though there is plenty to like about Far Cry 3, and I will probably give it a play through again at some stage, on a higher difficulty as the challenge of taken down outposts is worth it alone.",1,0,1

Valve is too busy creating cosmetics for easy money to fix bugs that have been in the game for years like creeps following you through fog of war or a more recent game breaking bug that causes the screen to freeze and turn completely white in the middle of the game forcing you to restart Dota with no guarantee that the game was paused. You can also expect to be put in low priority games about once a week because it currently takes around 3 reports in 20 games to send you to low prio. That is 3 people reporting you out of the possible 180. The game is centered around competitive play to the point that there is really no reason to play if you don’t intend on getting better. However the ranking system is currently the simplest and most inadequate of any “competitive” game out there if you win you get +25 MMR if you loss -25 no matter your performance. Go 15/2 as a phoenix that started the game as a support then was forced in to the carry role because you’re the only one that isn’t currently 0/10 clearly you’re not a good player or you could have won that game. The ranking system is so awful that a black market of accounts has popped up so now any scrub with 20 bucks can buy an account in your ranking were he doesn’t belong and give you 0% chance of winning the game.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is a game like no other. It has an amazing hardcore Medievil melee combat system that favours skill over luck and be aware of teammates swinging wildly as their is friendly fire. Its game modes are fun and have a decent variety, you have everything from your basic deathmatch modes such as team, free for all and one on one duels, but thier are also objective modes such as siege, all of them are fun and playable and action is always present. It has a small but dedicated community, and their has never been a time when I logged on and couldn't find a game. Their is a small selection of weapons for each class, some are better in certain aspects such as speed and power but all seem to have a good balance. Overall the game is a lot of fun and the melee combat is satisfying and One on One Duels are intense as hell at times. Highly recommended!

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Heh, if only the game worked like the trailer. Also, if you want to play this game, heres how my gameplay went;    Download the game after a long time thinking theres no such thing as a good free game Start as VS Own NC more than TR Become TR Too easy to kill people Become NC Feel the hardness to fight anyone else, having to develope creative tactics and aquiring friends along the way.  Still wondering if it was worth it or not, because the balance of weapons is off and messed up Continue fighting and playing hoping that the new developers would actually do something to smoothen out the balance My rating: 8/10 but it would only get the extra 2 if balance of weaponry was made Also, if anyone is going to get this game and they never played it before, watch out for Battle Rank 100s.  And now on to the hard truth. This game can turn really crappy, really fast. In my opinion, the NC should either have its damage fixed, or no one should play that faction at all. Their maxes suck, they have no weaponry compared the never ending rain of the TR and VS. The SMGs are out gunned due to firing rate as well as velocity and bullet drop + recoil. And all of our guns do such a small amount of about +30 damage that the TR and VS guns have already fired off their second shot by the time you first is 1/4s the distance from your target. TR and VS can put so much more damage on you because all they have to do is keep a crosshair on you. You have a maxed our shield? Gone, along with your health, you didn't need it. You have a composite armor tank, buggy, or plane? Pssh, 'Here, lemme jus throw my Vulcan and Gate keeper at it,' 'No! Let me throw my Saron and a version of the TR minigun at it!' I change my review, this game has taken, No, NC has taken a downfall, and it is still my favorite faction. If NC doesn't get fixed, guess the devs just lost a subscriber.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"As an FPS gamer i have always looked for one particular experience. Large scale battles with tons of players working together to accomplish an objective. I first looked at Halo, then Call of Duty and then i found Battlefield. I thought that was the largest scale battles i would ever find. Then Sony Online Entertainment released Planetside 2. Having played the first game a tiny bit and not really understanding what was going on i figured i would give this game a try.   I log in and do the tutorial and after learning which way is up i am dropped into the game. I click the instant action button and immediately i am dropped into the largest battle i had ever seen in a video game. I was a soldier in the New Congomerate and i immediately landed in front of a massive wall of Terran Republic tanks exchanging fire with a similarly sized wall of friendly tanks. Needless to say i was quickly shown that using the instant action button is not always the best idea. I respawn at a nearby sunderer and pick up the Engineer class and spent most of the time repairing tanks for our side. After an hour long slugfest it looked pretty grim, Until i saw a large number of friendly aircraft begin to fire upon and decimate the enemy line. We push through the decimated remains of the enemy forces and capture the nearby base. Needless to say after this, i was hooked. I would not hesitate for a second reccomending this game.  Pros: Large Scale Combat Persistant World Teamwork is emphasized.  Cons: Learning Curve is significant if you have not played an FPS game before.   Personal Note:  Instant Action is not refined enough in my opinion, It drops you where there is a large battle taking place between your faction and another. It does not always drop you close to allies and sometimes drops you literally right on top of the enemy. (as amusing as it is to kill an enemy galaxy with a drop pod, not exactly very fun when you get killed seconds later.)  I do not consider this a con as this does not impact my personal game experience enough for me to consider it a downside to the game. Instant action is not the only method of joining a battle, just the one that gets you into the fight the quickest.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"so um lets start with this, theres no blood. who makes a game of war and doesnt have blood? good job obama, real solid on that one. now for real tho, lets start with the battle visuals. now i run this in max with over 60 fps and the combat close up is prety much a bunch of gooks bumping into each other with no real life actions at all. like ppl get stabbed with spears and just ignore that a blade is in there back, no blood. also there are less units in this game then there is in empire total war, by far the worst one ive ever played. oooo two kinds of spearmen???!!!! no way!! and i also love how all the human armys have the same damn armys, orcs have the same armys ect. its like oh lets just make the bare min, throw in some dragons and call it $60 bucks. now for the amount of actual content there is in the game it just brakes $30. ive played every single total war game and to be honest this one is so dumbed down and noob friendly is gross. no units have any abilitys besides the stupid magic witch is 90% useless, they turned a good strat game into a point and click. and dont even get me started on the trash ive seen in online games. who needs army comp when one kind of unit can run over an army in one charge. its like they made this game not for the total war fans. but the people who never even played a total war game. i am so sad that i waisted 60 bucks on such a horrable game. THERES NO BLOOD!!! what in the hell is wrong with game developers these days. do you really think i want to watch these zombies just bump into each other with a little bit of screen shake?? u got to be kidding me. i want to see throats being ripped out. only complete tools would recommend this game. and if i spelled anything wrong or messed up some grammar im sorry. i care so little for this game it doesnt deserve anymore of my time. ima go chop heads off in rome 2 now. bye bye",-1,1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is all about adventure, carnage, the jungle aspect and getting the best guns for your assault type. There are a lot of areas where FarCry succeeds but many more where it simply falls through the floor.   Far Cry 3 offers a compelling storyline through the singleplayer campaign. It is almost unrivaled and allows you to take hold of a person and watch them grow from a normal friend-loving schoolboy to a psuedo-psycho badass of the jungle.   Multiplayer is completely broken as there a lot of bugs and hiccups along the way. The loadout option is pretty much useless as there is currently one build that destroys anything else that you put against it.   Coop is a very welcomed theme within the Far Cry series, it's just a shame it wasn't implemented into the overall storyline. Or atleast contained within it's own world. Rather than you and a friend playing within the island sandbox, you are forced to go through objective-based and competition-based tasks that follow a very crappy storyline of 4 people just wanting to get rich and get out.   ++ Singleplay, Multiplayer and COOP modes.  + Guns and tools are nice + Great scenery  +++Buy this game for the singleplayer  - Multiple bugs - Uplay requirements/overlay - Game-breaking bugs - Overpowered SMG class - Graphics are similar to FC2 but..worse?   I would only recommend this game for the singleplayer and nothing else. The coop is fun if you're with the right people and playing on INSANE mode.  ",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I like almost everything about the game except for the system is based on Pings, and they need to align quite closely among players to make the game-play fair. There is no system to keep those with insanely high pings out of a local server, and they ruin the game. The Devs acknowledge the need for aligned pings and even publish a guide on how to set/configure. No one does, and games are therefore unfair. If the Devs could find a way to limit server-entry by ping, it would be a superb game. As it is, it is pretty darn good, but so unfair most of the time that I cannot suggest it to newer players. If it is on sale (and sales are pretty common) then go for it! I truly like the game, I just dislike that one key point enough to not be able to suggest it.",-1,0,0

The mechanics are AMAZING from what I've seen online, butI've never gotten a chance to actually play more than the first 'level'.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"My rating on this fantastic shoter: 5/5  Some of the posetives: - Not Pay-to-win - Enormous 'maps'. Actually vast landcape. It requirew more than halph an hour flying to a pilot with a fast fighter, to visit all the 'facilities' on a condinet map. I played for a year in the past before setting up the steam version, and I still have not got familiarised with more than 10% of the map. The facilities do look alike, so you feel comfortable, but the many enviroments around them keep my interest always new. The strategic deplyment of a spone point (sundered) on a good positon at the various terens, is an interesting gaming experience all by itself for example. - Rewarding team-play. - The major problem of the game (not friendly to new players becous of its many options and mechanics), has now been treated with a small 'tutorial' available, and a small condinet accesible only from low-level players. - FANTASTIC, REALISTC, INTERESTING FEELING OF FUTURE WARFARE! STRATEGIC THINKING, GOOD POSITIONING AND COBAT TACTICS DO COUND, ALLOWING EVEN A LOW-LEVEL UNSKILLED UNDERARMED PLAYER TO POSSIBLY 'FARM' VERETANS OR TO REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OUTCOME OF A FACILITY ATTACK. - BIIIIIIG battles with countless ppl simultaneusly online.  Some of the negatives: -Lately it stasted to be a bit 'pay-to-win' becouse of the numerous old and experienced players that in rare occasions can make you feel a bit frastrated. At least for the NewConglomerate faction I play this year, that is usually the outnumbered proudly last-standing fighting force. -No proper joystick support. Fly mechanics are not the usual physics. -Too many players, enemies, vehicles, strategic locations etc, dissorient me when I start fighting in an unfamiliar arrea, so it is sometimes frastrating that i get killed many times without even knowing were the enemy is. But, on the other hand, this gives a real immersing feeling of being involved in a real combat  ",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"This review was posted by user 'cylian3' on the metacritic user reviews page on july 7, 2014:  'Never In my entire life have I witnessed a worse community revolving around a video-game than the one that is to be found in Dota 2. The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to 'Report player X' if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you're playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams.  Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2's hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they're feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that's me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for 'being unskilled'. As in, anyone. Even if they're level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA's like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons.  Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time..  Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you're just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal / text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn't for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be 'teamed' up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I'm reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts.  Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes &amp; items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn't for all the other flaws.  The commitment to play DotA MOBA's however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits 'addictive' qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It's painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated 'pubstomping'? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the 'normal' version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes.  I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone's time or dedication.'  With all this being said, I fully agree with the opinions articulated by this user and do NOT recommend this game as it is equivalent in an electronic sense to how alcohol and drug abuse would destroy psyches, lives, and families.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"  Warhammer total war - a game about beating hummies and getting crushed by dem fat dwarfs.  WH: TW is as of now a great game, with a medium rig (AMD 290) I manage to run ultra unit size, with everything else on ultra (still 60 fps). The game provides that huge varity in gameplay, but lack diversity in units for each faction (but thats why we got mods). While it´s lacking in diplomacy, as it´s quite hard for the orks to get good friends with anyone, but orks you are pretty limited to fighting and making sure you don´t loose every battle. This does lead to a big list of pros and cons, so I´ll do my best to get around all of them:  + Great preformance, already on launch (theres always someone, but you cant make everyone happy) + Straight forward in gameplay - just kill these guys and then kill some more.  + Easy for new players, no need to have Total war experience. + Mod support on release - made by modders like Magnar and Dresdner.  + Somewhat true to the lore and world of Warhammer. + overall great potentual for 'vs' or 'coop' campaign.   - Unit rooster is severly lacking! (Games workshop added what they had at the time on their webpage, but in-lore theres still tons of different units!  - obvious additions of a million future DLC´s - besides the obvious elephant in the room (Looking at you Chaos DLC) there will clearly be alot more of that to come; blood, factions and units will surely recieve a DLC in the future. - Campaign is as of now, abit short. There only two ways to win the game: short - capture two towns and destroy Chaos or long = dominate everything. - Lacking in replay-ability. Sure, you can play everyone, but with just 5/6 factions, you can only 'win' the game a certain amount of times before you done it all before. The victory conditions are also the same for each faction: same towns and destroy Chaos.   Alot of things will be fixed/added via mod support, but Sega and Games workshop will still delete those mods that will be future DLC´s, but surely we all understand the world of gaming as we live in, as of now not having DLC`s is just weird for every developer out there.   I got the game from a friend and not Sega, so no worries (I´m not paid to promote, sadly...).   All in all, I´ll give it a 5/7, it´s great, but not that great. If you want actual numbers = 7,5 / 10.    ",1,1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER," Summary:  A solid if somewhat unambitious addition to the TW series geared more towards new players.  Pros:  Well balanced, stable, a few new innovations.  Cons:  Many elements stripped down or removed from previous installments, suffers from TW's perennial issues of neurotic AI and an unbalanced endgame.  I've had a long, tumultuous relationship with the Total War series. From the processor melting release of Medieval II to the glory days of Shogun 2 I've stuck with it. After Rome II I swore I'd never buy one of their products at anything above bargain bin price, but like the siren song of Chaos I've fallen for Creative Assembly's wiles again and shelled out for my release week copy. Well, surprise surprise. I'm disappointed.  On the plus side, CA does seem to be learning from their mistakes. After the hot mess that was Rome II's release the team reigned in their ambitions and settled on a smaller, tighter experience. Siege attacks focus on a single wall 'segment', most unit armor and weapon upgrades have been jettisoned, and diplomacy has been whittled down to its barest essentials just to name a few areas they've put the screws to.  That's not to say there aren't real improvements here. A lot of the changes seem designed to shake up the samey game of 'smash your armored infantry blob into the enemy's face until their morale breaks' so many TW fights fall into. Magic has been added giving generals more offensive heft and lending more nuance to heroic abilities beyond simply spamming your buff buttons the second they recharge. Under the hood physics tweaks have drastically improved cavalry as well. Instead of stopping the moment they so much as tap an enemy horses will now plow into formations, or if the target is unfortunate enough to be loosely packed carve straight through them. Finally agents have been overhauled and can now fight in combat alongside your armies as little mini generals. I feel like CA really hit the mark on this one. They're strong and versatile enough to justify their presence in an army but not so overpowered that you would necessarily choose them over a good combat unit.  The problem is that even all that polish isn't enough to distract me from the essential truth. This is just another Total War game, with all the same issues that have plagued previous installments. Attempts to balance TW's old bugaboo of siege battles did make things more fair, but only barely and at the cost of some of the game's coolest looking set pieces. The AI is back to its old antics, attacking when it has no chance of winning and meandering around when it could. The endgame is similarly uneven. Depending where you are on the map the chaos invasion can be an existential threat or a positive benefit. I've had games where I was gearing up for the final epic confrontation only to find that the Imperials had already killed the chaos anti-christ and were well on their way to building tailoring workshops in hell. I mean it's nice to see that my allies had their ♥♥♥♥ together, but I was under the impression my attention was urgently required.  So all in all? It's progress. CA at least seem to be aware of the series' flaws and taken steps to fix them, even if it was a sort of stumbling half shuffle. If you're new to the Total War series and are looking for something to cut your teeth on Warhammer is a fine enough place to start. Likewise if you're a veteran TW player interested in the warhammer universe the borrowed concepts give a fresh enough buff to keep you interested for at least a playthrough or two. No doubt more DLC is already on the way, and in time Warhammer might be a truly worthwhile addition to the series, but I fear all that will be too little, too late.",-1,0,0

There is no content, sieges take far too long in about 100 turns I clicked next turn while sieging for about 80 of them. Missions need a complete overhaul and should not have made it in their present state past Beta Being given 4 turns to kill a general that is hunkered down in a walled city with a full stack and you are 2 turns away is pretty ludicrous and it happens far far too often.

It is not all bad, and if it goes on sale for cheap then you could probably pick it up without feeling like you're wasting your money.  Paying full price, however, is definitely a waste. The game has a feeling of being not quite finished, not that there are a lot of bugs, just that it needed some more tweaks and polish before release.   Some units are useless (I'm looking at you, Dwarfen Slayers), hero/lord skill trees are boring, and using Magic feels weak and unsatisfying. I strongly suspect that the developers will, at some point, release an overhaul, brand it as 'Emperor Edition' (as they did with Rome 2) and use it as an excuse to charge a bit extra money.  The DLC is also a naked money grab, adding little to nothing of worth in spite of the price tag.  Warhammer plus Total War was every nerd's wet dream; it should have been a great game.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"At the time of writing this review I only have 35 hours on record through Steam but I had originally downloaded this game outside of Steam a couple of years ago.  It's one that I play when the mood takes me but then can put it down and play other games, knowing that I can easily pick it up again.  Although the game has micro-transactions, you really don't need to spend real money on anything if you don't want to. It's one of the few 'free to play' games which I would say aren't 'pay to win'. Real money will get you faster progress but if you get into a fight with someone using the basic guns you start with, you have as good a chance as anyone with coming out on top!  The only thing I don't like about the game is that it can feel a bit clunky. This could be a latency issue considering the whole thing is online, but there have been times when I've been shot through a wall or when behind and I can only assume it is because the game is out of sync with the server.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Pros: Lots of choices on how to decorate 1 of 4 classes. Voice commands are hilarious some of the time At times can suck you into the action Time killer Some skill required TKing is punished via a scoreboard Awesome soundtrack Combo swings and avoid getting hit is the name of the game  Cons: Crashes Plenty of players but no middleground on quality, the first 15 ranks are glorious, but once you leave, you'll be stuck with people who literally waste time for fun and not in the fun way. If you want to avoid the trolls and exploiters you can't go back to the noob servers either. Classes are imbalanced Vanguards are bad enough with long swords, why is their midsection unhittable midswing? Considering every hit tends to land where it's aimed, not only is this imbalanced, but the more it happens the more jarring it is. After going through all the effort to make it realistic, it then suffers from LOL, halflife style play where your sword is super heavy, but you can move your hitboxes out of the way via rotation. Team frustration: friendly fire is locked to on. There is no off. Wow pvp style arena points, which causes people to steal your kills and in the process usually screw everyone over Toxic community: Feint? Do well? Tk someone who hit you first? Votekick a tker? It all boils down to how many friends you have: might makes right. Unfortunatly, with a lack of decent servers, this can literally spell the end of fun while you wait for them to go away. Mutes don't carry across games Trying to find a good server at bad times will either end with you in a server with toxic people and no exp or kicked for ping. Why can't we go back to the scrub servers? Why can't we have a couple higher level ranked servers? Server owners are anal, which seems to be the case with every medieval fanatasy fan base. (why are these people into this fandom when they have no honor or history?) if you don't know them you're insta out. FFA servers suffer from friends teaming up. Objectives are either won or you're forced to watch bad players.  You can kick, you can't vote ban. You can avoid kicks. Sometimes TKing is encouraged by your team. (!!!) Your team, with FF on and an imperitive to kill steal, will jump in front of you and prevent you from helping or making you so frustrated you swing through them, losing 10 points.  Broken, inbalanced mechanics that with recent announcements leads one to believe this game has already peaked and won't recieve proper love to fix the problems, so don't expect help.   6 dollars for a single skin? Of course they're not going to list their DLC on steam, lest it see a sale, which even then wouldn't be reasonable until at least 50%. All characters have the same access to the same weapons, the only other ones just being frill skins, once again overpriced.  That being said, the DLC skins are well done, it's just too bad they won't see the light of day on steam or a proper bundle. The best you can get is 1 skin for both sides, but only for the vanguard and knight and all the obvious favoritism on those two alone is reason for pause if you think they'll fix the balance issue.  Games decent but broken and it's peaked.  DLC prices need to come down and skins need to be bundled realistically. Emphasis on realistically.   You CAN have fun with this game, but once you're past rank 15, good luck.  I'd really, really, really, like to recomend this game, just can't.  For how broken it is, the DLC prices that aren't listed on steam are just a slap in the face. Stop making dlc and fix the game.  The sound track dlc is a steal though, Pick that up.   ...this game, unless it's fixed, is not exactly something I'd lead the Steam consoles era off with with, Gabe...",-1,0,0

It has no feature where you HAVE to buy thing things to continue playing, which is quite common it ftp games, but it has a nice shop (similar to TF2) where you can customize your heroes. Valve has provided a varierty of heroes to try out and lets you see who fits you best. It also doesn't make the game boring. There is some over-powered heroes (in my opinion). Combos between heroes and their abilities also provide enjoyment, expecially in parties.  The thing I don't like about Dota 2 is the hud size and some of the community. What I mean is, 'Report Drow because she noob' or 'Report Sniper because he op.' Some people are rude in chats and abuse the report feature. The hud size kind off effects the gameplay when you are trying to escape.  Something to add aswell; You had to pay to get this game, then it converted in an ftp. Thank you, Valve!

If you get reported, you will go to the overwatch when casual players determine if you were behaving bad or cheating. If not, you are without penalty. If they think you were cheating you will get VAC control. If VAC finds anything you will get banned. So basicaly, there is someone in real life that sees the play yoou were reported in. But in DotA2, if someone report you for whatever reason they choose you will get punished even if you were innocent.  For example, you want to play some hero and even showed and told the team before they made the move, they ignore you and then flame you for picking the hero anyway.. You may try your best, but since 98% ppl are under 110IQ (its truth) and they dont get what they are doing or even worse, that they are maybe wrong, they will report you for, lets say griefing. Since 98% are not that smart, this will happen TOO offen. And the result? You will get lower priority game.. EVEN after you WON the game for the ones that reported you.. Make sense? No. So, if you love DotA, you may try go back to old DotA game (W3 version).   And I will not write here about racist Russians, whos picking EU servers and yet not respecting the language.

This would be good, but there are numerous problems. It suffers a ridiculous amount from being pay to win and grinding for things is laughable, as the monetary amounts make Tribes items look like a walk in the park. I tried it for about 20 minutes, and all we did was hold in one position and literally run into an area and try to get 1 tiny piece of the area to actually 'win'.  Gameplay wise, its a basic FPS. There's nothing really spectacular about it that other games haven't done already or do better. The style of combat boils down to whoever can enmass the more overpowered equipment on one team at a time wins, and half the time you will spend more ingame time humping your way across the field to last about 20 seconds in the fighting area. It simply isn't a game that you can jump in and be on a decent even footing. The whole game reminds me of the Sleeper encounter from Everquest.

The ladder system is a mess. 1v1,2v2,3v3,4v4 there is no demarcation, there is no win loss stats to check, there is no monthly reset, the poor multiplayer experience makes me cross &gt;&lt;  After all isnt that the flippen point of warhammer &gt;&lt; multiplayer &gt;&lt;  It is really easy to burn through content in multiplayer and then your left with broken balance issues.   Thank goodness for the mod scene, some amazing mods, I particularly like regiments of renown idea to address some of the obvious balance issues. Why cant this be included in the real game.  multiplayer support is pretty dire, no mods allowed so that really limits the multiplayer experience.  DLC policy is a bit lame / greedy,  I just get the feeling that CA doesnt care about multiplayers much.  So that leaves single player which I am personally not interested in.  The magic system is basic and lame,   the lack of hero equipment is really poor in multiplayer, no mitigation items to counter hero snipe.  Get used to 2 shot hero snipe at the start of multiplayer battles. (dont remember that in any fantasy movies)  It might be worth getting when all the dlc is released and its on sale.",-1,1,0

I love the Total war series, but Creative Assembly taking things into fantasy was the best move they could have made.  From a very generic view, this game is great! Its is well optimized, it has AMAZING replayability, graphics are very good, the lore/stories are incredible, Warhammer lore is pretty in-depth. Ui and sound are great. If you have played a Total War game before you know Creative Assemblies DLC marketing strat, they release game, then several DLC that seem like big chunks of 'original' game. This strat is my biggest gripe. But that doesnt make the game bad, the marketing could use some tweaking but the game itself is outstanding! And most importantly, its FUN the gameplay is FUN, the story is FUN and the lore is FUN.  Graphics 9/10 Optimization 9/10 Sound 10/10 Replayabilty 100/10 DLC marketing strat 3/10 lol Overall a great game you will enjoy if you like Grand Stratagy and RTS. Overall score 9.5/10 ",1,0,1

363970,Clicker Heroes,"  Clicker Heroes Review      Overview   Clicker Heroes has came a long way, and is still my favourite clicker game to date. But sadly I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone with a brain.  The Big issue with this game now is how pricey the in-game shop is, to buy things in this shop you must aquire something called a 'ruby' and this ruby is expensive but the amount of rubies you need to buy something is also expensive the issue is the devs have introduced something called an auto clicker which is a hack you can buy in-game for an arm and a leg through again rubies now the going rate for this 'auto clicker' is 100 rubies and to buy 100 rubies is 10$ which is a copy of Fallout 3 or the Metro bundle on halloween. You can aquire enough rubies in-game to buy everything fairly spending no money..... If the auto clickers didint go up 50 rubies for each one you buy and the so called auto clicker can only be bound to one thing at a time which means to have it do what they say you would need more than one, which by going up by 50 each time you buy one makes it to where anyone who doesint spend money in this game get's ♥♥♥♥ed after the first 2 ones you buy, and the dlc for the zombie auto clicker skin is also 10$ and only gives you one auto clicker with it, so basicly if you buy the dlc you get a free skin and a auto clicker both very simple things that require no effort to make. But the devs want 10$ for it and not to mention the skin is a poorly made dull zombie hand with no extra added special effects to make it in anyway shape or form worth the money. The devs want to charge crazy amounts of money for hardly any reward and for that this game went from a 8/10 to a 3/10.  I did not go into deep detail because well, this is a clicker game.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Grand Theft Auto on a tropical island! I picked this one up for under $10 in a holiday sale after watching a friend play. Not normally my kind of game, the closest I've gotten to is Skyrim or GTA3.  The game is a lot more linier than I expected which is a bit of a let down, once you start a mission you are pretty much stuck until you complete it. I guess this is a lot like GTA3 was, but that game is old now, and these days I expect better. There is also a lack of choises as you progress through the plot, which is something else we're used to with Mass Effect and Skyrim. At times it felt like I was being dragged through the story rather than watching it.  The biggest problem though is Uplay, you have to sign up with it to play and if you're not online you get a lot of nag screens asking you to connect. You would have thought Steam provided all the DRM the game needed without having to deal with Uplay as well.

570,Dota 2,"Why i don't like the game:  First of all and most important, this is not NOT not NOT a team game. Why?   -The game structure and meta is focused on making one player fed and then he carries his team to victory.  -Supports have to stay far away from the other team mate in the lane they share because this way only the other guy will have the full experience from cs(if both stay together, they will have the exp shared between them, so this means that they both can fall behind fast compared to the other team). (and don’t even dream on touching the cs of the guy. As if the toxicity of most players wasn’t enough, you have to only have fun in this game without taking part of the action for the most part of the laning phase. Pffffttttt. Can this be more stupid as it is? Yes. Just continue reading)  -Only one player can buy wards. Yup. The same guy that has to sit on his thumb since the beginning of the game.  • Other gameplay mechanics:  Controlling the currier is frustrating, especially when you want an item and he is going to grab something for another player. You have to wait. And then you have to be positioned in a way that the currier will not get killed by the enemy. As if you can control that (ex: when you are getting killed because of a gank in the same moment that the currier arrives. o.0)  There is a secret store. As if buying wasn’t a frustrating experience for new players. This store has some recipe items for the most OP higher rank items. Good luck understanding that in the tutorial or in the actual custom item build section of the game were they don’t show you the recipes.  You are close to victory and just destroyed the inner turret of mid lane. Then you see 2 melee barracks and2 ranged barracks and 4 other structures. I only ask why? Why so many useless stuff between me and my team mates victory?  River runes. Random spawned runes that give various bonuses. It’s a rush game for them. They cannot actually be contested. It’s” just pick me up” and you will have a stupid game mechanic that sometimes can be OP (if you find the double damage). I think it’s stupid and it doesn’t favor the good players.  Hey look. I’m with low HP and I need some health. Ohhhhhhhhh. I know. I’ll eat a tree. -.-‘  Loosing gold after death. As if cs was an easy task. Let me explain. You are playing a ranged champ. And you see a low hp minion. You think: ok since I am low level I’ll hit it only when he is really low. Yeaaaaahhhhhh. My bullet took 15 years to travel to him, so now I have to try to approach the cs with so much anticipation that even the enemy will know what I’m trying to do, and now they can hit me for free every freaking time. And now another fun game mechanic for noobs: I’m dead and my item is there for grabs (only some higher “ranked” items). Hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Glyph of fortification: omg. Really? Is this a good thing? Protecting structures for a short period of time. This combined with some other stuff makes the game last longer than it should (in conjunction with players being afraid of being killed by the enemy fed player, being afraid of stealing kills, afraid of stealing creep score, of dying and droping items and being flamed at because you are a noob (even if you play the game for like 1000 years). The game is actually boring because it lasts too long. It’s unrewarding from beginning to end and a frustrating experience, and more so for new players that have to learn all this stupid stuff that is totally questionable if it’s good for the game or not. Other moba game players look at this and say: DAMN BITCCCCHHHH. FK THIS CRRRAAAAAP. (vomit)  Speaking of vomit. Rushan drops a cheese. (not a wood(y). But at least I beg some coherence in this crap. Why food when players can eat wood?)   • Some small things I think that ruin the game  Buy teleport scrolls. With what space in the inventory? The same space I need to have my recipe components of the item I want and potions and my wood(y) eating crapp? Ohhhhh. Ok.  Learning the jungle creeps. Some of them are not affected by skills from champs. Can this game be more boring and slower? I can’t even use my skills? Really? Damn.  Learning the champions. Yeah. Good luck on that noob. Learning all of them will take weeks (at least to understand what they do when you face them in the enemy team). There isn’t any good info on how to play them or to make item builds for them (try the in game item build and you will cry) it’s just looking at people doing things and no actual guide on how and why (DOTA players do this on purpose, so they can rub on noobs faces that this game is much complicated that LOL. Yes it is. It’s too much stupid useless stuff on it. It doesn’t make any sense. When they say that more skill is needed for this game it’s a lie. This game is slower. You have time to think, and dream, and take a bath, and kiss your girl, and then you fail the last hit on the cs. But if you get unlucky (vs a more experienced guy) you will die. Yup. Tadaaaaaaaaa. The same as any other game. Pfffttttt. Duhhhh. And face rolling (in the key board) is slower. Even that is boring. Jesus. Being hit by the crowd control skill that lasts for 5 years will make you die (eventually, I hope), and this is why this game is ruthless on mistakes. Ohh wait. One stun that needs no skill to hit (it isn’t a skill shot) and lasts 5 years is another reason why dota players say that this game is ruthless and needs more skill than other mobas. Yup, fk logic.  All “high rank items” are freaking expensive. Why? They know that this game will take too freaking long, and it will be no fun, then they make you suffer to get a full build before the game ends. DOTA2 devs say: suffer biiiitttttccccctcheeeesssssss.  When you win a game, you will earn some random useless (immediately useless. Maybe useful later, I don’t care) stuff that you can blender with some other useless stuff, so you can get one random useless thingy, and there are ways to take advantage of this, like special recipes or whatever (another thing to look at in guides and make you waste more time looking for stuff on the internet and not appreciating a good gaming time). This is a must for me: a big effort (trying to win games) just to get one random stuff that isn’t going to make my game experience better. Essentially, no rewards. Wow, nice.  Denying. Omg. Denying cs. Hahahahaha. The enemy will earn exp because you killed your own minion. Fk logic. This is another reason that the freaking game is so boring and takes too long. And to add pain to injury: suicide. Hahahahahahahahaha. This one just killed me. You can actually deny your death to the enemy team. Ok, listen carefully. I will only play this game if they make one item I just came up with. The item is a strapon, and it’s called U.R.ACuuuUNnnnT. this item could be activated when team members have less than 75% HP, and it will kill then instantly and has no cooldown what so ever. This is actually the only thing that is missing from this game to make it totally fked up. And another: an item that denies the cs denial. And can deny the deny from the deny that was denyed in the first place. How about that for a mind fk.    Overall, the game looks bad in my opinion (it reminds me of Diablo 2 graphics but in hd and polished), its slow, unrewarding, it’s not a team game, lots of toxic players, the game has an individual ranking system (in a fk ing team game!!!! Wut?). It’s bad like the most known mobas.  You want to kill your brain cells. Try this game. It will make you angry and you will lose the perception of what a fun “thing” is in real life.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I've enjoyed this game for a long time now. It was the first game I have ever bought on steam and is the main reason I came to steam in the first place, but after playing close to 230 hours of this game I cannot recommend it. Lets break this into Pros and Cons.  Pros: -This game has an amazing combat system unlike any other game. It is increadibly fun to learn and takes time to master. -Large variety of well done maps that really give of a medievaly atmosphere. -The Ingame voices are fun. (Expecially taunting) -There are multiple gamemodes. -It has a good community... sometimes. -There are servers for new players (Rank 15 and under) -Graphics are pretty cool. -Large but limited variety of weapons. -Lots of content on the steam workshop for this game.  Thats about it for the Pros...  Cons: -Very Buggy. Developers put more time into adding cosmetics than fixing very irritating bugs that have been in the game for a very long time. -There are two types of people that play this game, Newcomers, and Veterans, nothing in between, so it eathier going to be too easy or way too hard. -The community is sometimes pretty toxic. This doesn't mean you won't find nice players but a large amount of them are just straight-up ***holes. -Rank 15 and under serves is pretty much a compitition to see who can swing their sword the most and the fastest. -Most high rank players use an exploit called dragging. This takes away from the realisim of the game aswell as makes it impossible for new playes to adapt to the game. The high ranked players also refuse to recognize this as an exploit.  -As soon as you turn to rank 16 you are put with players of upwards to rank 40+ (Balancing is non-existent in this game) This results in a very steep learning curve, which, dont get me wrong, is not a bad thing, but it's just not for some people. -Gamemodes such as Team Objective and Team Deathmatch are usually stacked, meaning that one team usually has the majority of the high ranks and the other team has low ranking players. (Just imagine a group Sumo Wrestlers going against some really nerdy kids) Only if you're lucky you will find a balanced server. -This game is as optimized as a potato. You better have a good computer if you want to play this. -The community is dwindling fairly quickly. When I started playing there was on average around 5000 people playing at a time, now its around 1500 on a good day. -(For me personally) once I unlocked all of the weapons, the game started to go downhill. There was no challange or objective while playing.  Just a Few side notes: -Don't get this game if you have anger management problems... just don't. -Don't get this game if you do not have a very good computer... It will run like absolute cow dung. -Get this game only when it's on sale... whatever you do, do not pay $25 for this. It's really not worth it. -Get this game if you are going to play with frends. If you're going solo, you're gonna have a bad time. -If you do get this game, never play after 11:00pm... Thats when all the super tryhards come out of their caves.  Peronal Note: Don't get me wrong here, I absolutly loved this game. There were lots of good times to be had with friends when I first started. There is just simply too much wrong with this game for it to be enjoyable anymore. But at the end of the day, it's up to you if you want the game. Go on and check out some other reviews and compare them to mine and see if you notice a common theme.  Also if you are thinking about commenting with something along the lines of dragging. Don't, you might get some of your nerd sweat in your keyboard, and we wouldn't want that now would we.",-1,1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"This game is perfection among the small MMOFPS realm's players. It bridges the gap between shooting things and 3,000 player servers, while looking beatiful in the process.  I've played this game since beta. A lot has changed, but on the other hand, a lot hasn't. The large scale combat -- more than 500-person battles -- is the same. What has changed are the people participating in it. A few months after release, you now find small (or large) Clans, aka. 'Outfits,' the concept is the same. You cannot play this game without finding a group of people to play with. It thrives on massive numbers, solo'ing will not get you anywhere. It's not difficult, almost every server has a couple Outfits recruiting.   The gun mechanics are simply amazing, though it does have it's buggy moments. The customization is in-depth and costly, as to get an attachment you're going to have to sit down and play for at least an hour at once. They counter this by making it worthwhile: all of the attachments are good. There is no 'bad' attachment.   Doing all of this and more, the graphics are simply astounding, assuming you have the hardware to run it. I run a 7970 @ 1100/1500 Core/Memory respectively, and an i5 3570k @ 4.4 and still struggle to get 60fps @ 1600x900. This is a very intensive game on both the GPU and the CPU, so you're not going to be getting away with an i3 3220 by any means.   Best of all, it's free to play, so there's no reason not to try it. See you on the battlefield.  ",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"This game is good. It can be very, very grindy at times, but overall it is an extremely enjoyable experience that you do not have to pay a cent to really get the atmosphere of a 90+ man TR rush on your last base before the warpgate. Your outfits on NC ally up. KAIN is formed. I was a member of the 301st airborne division. Our job was to scout out what was ahead of us, and ground pound the hell out of everything we saw. Needless to say, we ended up locking that continent within two hours that fateful wednesay. Due to a guy who will know who he is (SAHADES, not his name, but very similiar), we manage to co-ordinate, the Germans, French, English speaking air units to help the convoy of sunderers and Vanguards and Lightning Skyguards littered across the landscape. If you want to judge visuals, then look at my screenshot library. With a powerful PC, this game can look absolutely stunning. The backdrop of the moon with lasers lighting up the sky in front of a moonlit tree gives me shivers down my spine.   The development team is also excellent, and everyone there is very, very willing to listen to complaints and are extremely dedicated (Sony invested a lot of money into this).",1,0,1
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Ok so this game get's a lot of hate for having a toxic community and exploiters everywhere.  I haven't played this game much (by my standards) but this has the best medieval combat I've ever seen, and the parry/riposte system can lead to interesting situations, like for instance I was playing as a Man-at-Arms, my main playstyle, and I had made my way to the enemy lines with an enemy knight chasing me, I then took down an archer who was harrasing my team and turned to face my pursuers, which by this time had becoem two knights. I then got into a swordfight with the two fully armed knights, holding my own and slaying one before they got help.  The situations that can happen can make you feel like a legitimate knight, fighting for his life, which is very thrilling.  9/10, for amazing medieval combat.",1,0,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Warhammer: Total War is pretty cool, I guess.  Set in the grim dark future of the 41st Millennium, mankind has spread throughout the galaxy thanks to the leadership of the Emperor of Mankind and his Space Marines. But Horus, his most favored son, betrayed the Emperor and began a war known as the Horus Heresy. The Emperor defeated Horus, but was injured and force to-   What? Warhammer FANTASY?   Oops.   Set on a fantasy world where war is constant. The Empire, formed by the great Sigmar thousands of years ago, is beset on all sides by legions of the undead, the endless Green tide of Orcs, and the ruinous powers of Chaos. Now with the End Times before them, Emperor Karl Franz must unite the Empire of Man, while the grudge-keeping Dwarves of the eastern mountains must prepare for not only the Green Tide, but threats from the north as well.   Warhammer: Total War is another game in the long running Total War series, but stands out as one of the first licensed total war games. Warhammer and Total War together kind of feels like a match made in heaven, but you can still pretend it's historical if you're a purist if you sniff as much glue as I do.   You can play as a number of factions such as.  The Empire: Humans who make up for their short comings by shooting you in the face.  Orcs: Green brutes who overwhelm their enemies with numbers and giant monsters.  Vampire Count: Powerful vampires and necromancers who command thousands of spooky skeletons and goofy looking undead monsters who all conveniently forgot how to use a bow.  And who could forget best girl: The Dwarves, short angry men with amazing beards who will never forget that you didn't hold the elevator for them. NEVER. FORGET.   There are also two DLC factions that cost money because you and I are both chumps as well as a free DLC faction that nobody cares about because they aren't playable in campaign.   Warriors of Chaos: Larger, angrier, spikier humans who take candy from babies and then eat said baby.   Beastmen: Large goat men who's panties are constantly in a bunch and are capable of hiding thousands of goat men behind a single tree.   And Bretonnians: Losers.    Each campaign has it's own play style and require their own set of strategies to overcome your foe. Or you can just spam handgun units and pretend you're playing Empire: Total War again, I'm not going to judge.  Okay, I'll judge a little.   There are two modes of play, a turn based campaign mode where you build your empire, your armies, and set off to conquer foreign lands in the name of whatever lord you decided you wanted a hug pillow of. And the real time strategy element where you command said armies into battle and watch them slap each other with comically oversized axes and swords.   They're both very competent, but that's expected from the series at this point. There's enough detail in building up your provinces and managing both money and your armies to give the campaign mode a lot of weight, and the free-flowing nature of campaigns themselves means you can write your own narrative for whatever war you fight. Combat is also pretty competent, but also kind of predictable. The Enemy calvary will always flank and the infantry will always try to rush the high ground if they can. Calvary flanking is of course, expected, but sometimes I just kind of put my army into the corner of the map where they can't go around and they still try to sneak around the sides. Bless their little hearts.   There are a few things about the game that really bumbles my jumbles, though. The battles are over a little too quickly, town development is too simple, sieges are underwhelming, castles walls act like frigging gatling guns, diplomacy barely works, and I sometimes feel that the A.I is cheating me by churning out units that they shouldn't be able to get. And the Vampire Count's corruption expands so slowly I may as well play an actual game of Warhammer in the meantime.   There was also a gripe about certain races only being able to occupy certain areas, but that is actually dealt with in a mod. Still, it's not in the base game, so I still have to wag a finger at it and call it a jerk.   I also don't agree with Creative Assembly's (or Sega's) DLC plan for the game. It almost feels like you bought the basic package for one of those toy-based video games like Skylanders or Disney's whatjamacallit. The base game is fine on itself, but I feel like other people would feel cheated since there are a few things that should be in the game that was clearly taken out for DLC purposes.   But should you play Battlewrench: Absolute Fight?   Well I certainly like it over a few other Total War games. The game is competent for a Warhammer game and there's enough variety in the factions to keep you coming back for some time. I would like to see more custom options for the campaign mode and maybe a little more customization for armies themselves like maybe an army painter or a general/hero customize option. Also, are we ever getting avatar warfare from Shogun 2 back? It wasn't perfect, but it was a neat little metagame for multiplayer.   I would say pick it up, but maybe not at full price, considering they're DLC policy they apparently seem to live by.   Warhams: Total war gets 9 disgruntled dwarves out of 4 gods of Chaos.   Warhammer Fantasy doesn't really exist anymore. Now we have golden space marines with giant hammers.   The Curator:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation  ",1,1,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 was born out of Interplay's sordid history. Black Isle had already created it's own version of Fallout 3 that was never sold. Instead Interplay sold off the rights of Fallout to Bethesda who made this version on Oblivion's engine.  As much as I rag on Fallout 3 I have to acknowledge that Bethesda really went above and beyond with how well they did their homework. Most of the subtle 1950's satire was replicated extremely well with this game. Adding to that they decided to set it in D.C. to have creative control which was an excellent idea in my opinion. It allowed for unique locations like Little Lamplight, the Dunwich building and the Oasis.   However where my complaints start mostly have to do with the plot and the gameplay. For starters the main quest is moralistic garbage, painting the protagonist with the broadest brush possible as either the savior of humanity or the antichrist. The gameplay was also very video-gamey. With enemies taking a full 10 bullets to the face and still not dying.  There are mods that fix most of my complaints besides the plot. Even still when New Vegas came out 2 years later I found it fixed all the problems I saw with F3. Regardless, Fallout 3 is still a very enjoyable experience. Just not a perfect one.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11214131 ",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I tried to like this game, I really did, I saw youtube videos about this game, and thought it looked very good, but never bothered to get it cause I'm stingy, so when my friend offered me a free copy I said yes. Now I feel bad for him cause he has wasted a copy on me, I actually hate this game, the hit detection is boasted about in videos yet in practice it plainly sucks, I'll be right in someones face using one of the longer weapons in the game, when i go to swing at them I don't seem to hit them, hit detection is laughably horrid in this game.  The graphics are decent, the maps are good, the game modes are great! However these are let down by awful animations and the lack of entertainment value, combat is dumb, no strategy is required, all you have to do is hit first (if you can even hit at all), only 2 of the 4 classes are useful, controls are horrible and for some reason the mouse on the menu has input lag which really pisses me off, yet somehow the camera in game has no input lag what so ever. Also someone please direct me to the brainless idiot who decided that it's a good idea to let both team change their armour to the colour black, when you see a guy in black you don't know if they are friend or foe until you hover your cursor over them and check the colour of their name at the bottom, and sometimes you aren't in the position to be able to, so you won't know if they are an enemy until it's too late.  To top it all off, I get mad at this game cause of how laughable it is and how hard it trys to be a good game then ends up falling on its face, this game has a great feeling to it, until you start playing, then you just want to quit after a few minutes.  I tried to give this game a chance, I gave it 5-6 hours to try and give me a reason to stay, but It failed and I've simply uninstalled it, and I'll never play it again.   I give this game 2/10 simply because it fails to impress, with the only good features being the well designed maps and the variety of game modes.

570,Dota 2,"I would like to start this review by saying everyone is entitled to an opinion. You are allowed to like or not like something or you can feel a certain way about the game or anything for that matter. I would also like to say that anyone is allowed to write a review no matter what kind of game you like action fps, strategy, or whatever. I am not a MOBA guy but like everyone else I have the right of press. Now if you don't like that to bad cry me a river.   What should I say about dota? Basically it’s boring. I’m sorry valve for this. I am a big fan but this is just not fun at all! It’s boring nothing new here nothing original. The only thing good to come out of this is the different characters. I found some amusing with little bits of laugh and nothing really special though. A lot are also rip offs of LOL (league of legends). I haven't played much LOL but I do have done my homework on it and know LOL came first before DOTA 2. I'm not a MOBA guy because I find them boring and I think it’s more fun to be in the action with lots of different cool things happening.   This I do not recommend even to the hardcore valve players because valve has mostly been doing fps and not really a whole lot else. The game is also very unoriginal. There are so many games like this and it's all the same thing destroy this then this and that it gets old. It did add some interesting twist but nothing amazing. Now you could say this is the same deal with first person shooters. It is a lot. Lots of fps now days are shoot this guy then capture this flag blah blah blah, but if you pick the right fps you can get fun gameplay, story narrative, maps, good multiplayer with fun twist. Also too many mircotransactions in DOTA 2.   It’s not exactly pay to win but it's really annoying have BUY THIS BUY THAT shoved in my face. Also graphics are not good. I do understand the graphic limitations of the source engine but really valve, Half-life 2 A GAME FROM 2004 LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER! Titanfall runs on a slightly modified version of source and looks better.   Also the game has lots of bugs. Lots of different things like clipping through objects random death. Also the learning curve is very very very hard! You will die a lot and it will take a lot of hours (more than mine) to get even just okay.   The bots are also very very hard and O.P. The game is also very unbalanced. I keep getting stuck with a bunch of bad players against good ones. Also the servers are screwed up. (IM NOT A RACIST) When you join a US server I want US players because of the LANGUAGE BARRIER (Told you I'm not racist!) I love Russians I think they are funny but when we need to communicate but when I can't understand them that sucks.   Also almost everyone you meet is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag. Everyone’s like GO (insert Harmful suggestion here) yourself. I'm gunna (insert Harmful suggestion here) your (insert Harmful suggestion here) you can't (insert Harmful suggestion here) for weeks. Yeah not the best of people.  Also a quick personal story involving DOTA 2. They are one of the most toxic communities I have ever met. When I made a post saying I wasn't a fan of the game and asked other people how they felt about it I was immediately struck with horrific comments. Such as, kill yourself, your'e ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you should have been aborted, you must have been dropped on your head as a baby, and many more things that are very illegal to say to other people.  The short is boring unoriginal and it’s not fun with your friends unless you are constantly cracking jokes which is hard during a mind numbingly boring game. So don’t waste your time with this and just do something else like half-life or another valve game.It’s not good (the trailer is also misleading).",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Baring the initial release bug which made the game hang up at the splash screen (6 hours for a fix, quick turn around and lots of engagement from CA devs on the subreddit), the game is working great! This has to be the most optimised Total War game to date and also the most diverse in both units and factions. Additionally, the Vampiric and Chaotic corruptions along with Empire confederation (Dwarf/Greenskin can also) have added a new strategic level to the campgain map.  Some systems like 'food' have been completely removed which in my opinion, opens the game up for a lot more fun. There is very little need to 'balance' your provinces like previous games. At most, I found myself building only max tier 3 buildings in small settlements as they cannot buil tier 4 and 5 (where the really cool stuff is!) which is fine.  So far, battles seems to be too fast, but I suspect this will either be patched soon OR a mod will be released to fix this issue.   As a long time Total War fan and fan of Warhammer, this game hits all the spots and I can certainly recomend it if you like these genres!",1,0,1
570,Dota 2,"This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The only reason you should get this is if you want anxiety problems and severe anger issues. My winrate may be around 50/50, but in a ratio of decent matches and good matches to a 'normal' match (which is not good) is probably 10/90. I have never been in a game where: -Everyone speaks english on the us servers -Someone willingly supports and buy wards, courier, and doesnt take all the kills on purpose -Someone abuses their mic with loud and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music Also someone disconnects every other game and usually dont come back.  AND dont even get me started on ranked. You expect it to be better, like getting a phone upgrade. NO. The enemy team picks axe and meepo, and you lost 8/10 starting matches. My starting MMR was 1200, and even after like 50 more ranked matches it hasnt moved. 1200s. There is no cooperation in this 'teamwork' game, and people rarely communicate. After a while I installed League of Legends, and it was really easy compared to Dota. Turns out it was, and everyone who has played both MOBAs agrees that Dota is more difficult and complicated. I still play both but the only reason YOU should get this game is if you want to get a head start for League. Not saying that it is better; both games and pros and plenty of cons, but Dota has more cons in the community, not the game. Everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ (including me) and probably the harshest group of people ever. Imagine Call of Duty with only 10 year olds, but with less racism and they cant speak english. Overall, this game gave me cancer, and you shouldnt play any MOBAs.

When playing as the Empire you can feel the 'realistic' side of warfare, With swords, crossbows, cannons and cavalry, While on the other hand playing as the Vampires or Orcs is completely a different story.  Quest battles are amazing too, Gets you in-depth of the story of each leader, But putting that aside its battles are great.

Also there are no star athletes. I am quite honestly disappointed in the way the video game industry is advancing. It seems like its been ages since the last truly good game that had Dio Brando as the star athelete featured Dante from the Devil May Cry series.

265930,Goat Simulator,"This game seems as if it would be fun for its 'so bad it's good' nature, and there are perhaps moments of enjoyment which can be brought forth from experiencing the zaniness within. However, the central gimmick this game relies on, being a purposefully broken, buggy game, falls short of being anything more than a mere novelty worthy of no more than a brief period of attention.  The ultimate problem comes not with the joke becoming old fast, however, though that is still a problem. The real problem is the lack of truly having anything to do. In this game, you can wander around and headbutt things and lick things and maybe use an item or two found around the world you wander through. Every once in a while you may discover some new ability, but the abilities don't refresh any replay value the game could've had since the abilities are typically something like becoming stronger, a feat which is entertaining for approximately two seconds.  Besides lacking in meaningful character advancement, the other central problem is the size of the worlds you occupy. I've not played the DLC (and I'd rather not bother), but the overall size of the base game is quite minuscule, as if even the developers were unsure of how they could keep a game like this interesting enough for so long without adding some new tacky, inane gimmick in their DLC. It's small even for ten dollars (thankfully I paid far less), so I don't recommend, if you dare bother, picking this up for that price.  This game is a clear case of 'it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.' People lapped it up easily due to the 'so bad it's good' label anyway, what with this game becoming easy fodder for people on YouTube to flail about like goons while they giggle and chort over the most mundane occurences within the game. This game, more than anything, readily showcases a major problem within video games, the dumbing down of content and willingness to accept ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game is not the worst I've played, since I will give it some slack for at least trying to some extent, but I still would strongly consider this a candidate as one of the worst video games ever.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Left my positive review up for a long time, in honour of all the fun this game once gave me - but I recently uninstalled it, because ♥♥♥♥ it. High-level play is simply not fun - it's based around mechanics exploits. Some will argue whether they are 'exploits' and that's fine - but the fact remains they are NO FUN. Even when the servers seem well-balanced, 99% of team objective games involve one side completely stomping the other. It's vaguely kind of enjoyable when you are the stomper the first few times, but eventually anyone who actually enjoys gaming will long for the rare *close* matches, whether they win or lose them. Once in a blue moon, you really do get a magnificent match - two skilled teams grinding away at each other, neither one utterly dominated by spinners and clanfolk, slowly giving and losing ground, until it comes down to a frantic 1-minute count on the final objective -- and when that happens, it honestly doesn't matter who wins, the game is so much fun for everyone. But those games have gotten rarer and rarer and rarer as the community has gotten worse and worse and worse (and 'better' - in the sense of racking up cheap kills that preclude any of the interesting mid-battle duels that used to happen), and now it's just not worth it anymore.",-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"My stats are slightly confusing as they don't seem to count timing correctly. I must have played about 50-60 hours by now or so which is fair enough to make a review. As reference I finished the game once with a few side quests (about 30-40 hours, and made another build to do a casual powerrun which finished the game in 10-11 hours. Faster is possible obviously but you'd miss the entire idea behind the Fallout games if you did.  Compared to New Vegas, Fallout 3 is a lot more straightforward as less speech options really determine how the game flows, however at the same time more survival/radiation build. You get less traces on your map, less evident companions, you're more left to yourself basically. Which is nice too, it's just different from New Vegas.  Of course you'll always have Three Dog and a friendly reminder that not everyone wants to set the world on fire which is conforting in its own right.  All in all, a very decent RPG game that I can fully advice to anyone. BTW, if you only have a dualcore but you have windows 7, the game will run just fine ;)",1,0,1

Planes are useless without upgraded weapons, and so are the tanks. There's also an exoskeleton called the 'MAX' which, again, is rediculously sh*t without upgrades, but crazy OP with a bunch of different weapons and a mechanic to keep it alive.. it can either be a 1 man army or a useless slowpoke depending on how much time/money you're willing to invest into it  5/10 fun game but extremely pay2win/grindy  oh, and there is absolutely no lore/story you get to learn about. you just get dropped on a massive world with 4 continents with no real clue what each faction is after/why they are fighting or anything like that.",-1,0,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 fulfills all the 'standard' FPS requirements of modern gaming. There's guns, there's violence, and finally, there's shenanigans. If you don't know what I mean by that, then you've never found a creative or humiliating way to kill someone in a game (of which Planetside 2 has plenty.) It goes above and beyond by having a balanced class structure, with all six classes having a distinct role in combat. With that said, and the aforementioned insane amount of weapons, attachments, and not to mention cosmetic items, you can play this game pretty much however you want. Want to spear the assault and go in guns blazing? Check. Want to be that sneaky, shady guy in the corner, promoting open-mindedness one bullet at a time? Check. Or maybe you want to be some form of support, either by repairing things or patching up people? Yup, it's got those too. The vehicles are very well implemented, too, allowing you to rule the skies in either fighter aircraft, gunships, or a large troop transporter. Add in tanks, buggies, ATV's, and a combat bus (No, I'm not making that up) and you make for an insanity-fest just waiting to happen. Oh, and the absolutely massive battles don't help this. Sometimes, you're in three man skirmishes, and other times... you just run face-first into an armored column of no less than thirty tanks. It's big, it's scary, and damn if it isn't fun.

265930,Goat Simulator,"At this point I have 180 hours to this “game”, &amp; I use that word lightly. It is unlike anything else I have ever played before.  Goat Simulator originally was a hoax, a trailer from Swedish based Coffee Stain Studios poking fun at the seemingly endless barrage of mind numbingly boring simulators flooding the market, but as the collective response of the mentally challenged individuals on the web screamed YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GAME, there was only one obvious rout to go, and thus Goat Simulator was born.  With a very short development time Coffee Stain Studios have admitted there are bugs [and will only fix game breaking ones], but ask you embrace them as they make the game more entertaining. I mean how was a Goat supposed to climb a ladder anyways?  The objective, if you can call it that is to mooch about doing everyday goat activities, like destroying Goat hendg, interrupting protests about pennies shaped foods, destroying Coffee Stain Studios office, sacrificing unsuspecting individuals to become a satanic goat, welding almost any object with your tongue, bouncing on trampolines, riding bicycles, eating mushrooms, being abducted by aliens, buying hats, licking anything and everything, parkour, taking over deadmau5 rooftop party, strapping fireworks to your back, pushing boulders into garden barbeques, Ow, if you were expecting things to make sense then you’re an idiot.  Now with the addition of 4 DLC’s, MMO, Goatz, Payday &amp; Waste of Space you can expand the bazaar &amp; ultimately pointless shenanigans of the everyday life of a Goat and its friends it numerous ways. Adding story arcs, new maps, vehicles, quests and more, if you were one of the weird people that enjoyed the base game then this is more of the same on a stupider and grander scale.

Back then, I was pleasantly surprised by the variation between factions, each race bringing its own twist to the campaign map, and by the fun factor of the battles ; but for me it lacked the replayability of the other games of the franchise due to boring settlement management and limited diplomatic options with few relevant AI-controlled factions on the map. Since then, the DLC and FLC have added new factions (even if you do not own the DLC you will see the new factions under the control of the AI) and the campaign is considerabely more dynamic and unpredictable.  + Diversity of factions AND rosters + Fun and brutal battles + Minotaurs - Price of DLC - Campaign management streamlined",1,0,1

But the overall combat has changed so much and i cant really point out when it happened, it seems to have either happened with the dlc or just before but i can safely say this game just inst worth buying anymore. all the jokes the community had about the class, the vanguard just faces down, the knight does the same and everyone set mouse sensevity to full and suddenly its become the only way most people play and use it to dodge everything and get though any block.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Free Chaos DLC period is almost over, so I'd like to give some insight on the game (debatable) faults for those of you, that still can't decide if this game is worth buying. I'll write in no particular order, mind you:  1. Cheating AI. To usual economic cheats (enemy can sustain big stack of mid/top tier armies even when he owns one province) a movement cheat was added. AI can move farther than you and move after attacking a city and razing/sacking it, while player lose all movement points after succesful siege. This creates situations when you chase an enemy for multiple turns with multiple armies, trying to corner him. AI also seem to know your army composition, because when two full stack armies face each other, enemy will run if autoresolve is not in his favor (even before you initiate a battle, you, as a player, learn later about autoresolve obviously). You can use agents to block enemy movement, yes, but forcing a player to use them feels inappropriate.  2. Tactical battles. There's no unit formation. No loose, no wedge, no nothing. Battles seem to be even more fast-paced than before. I don't think even one of mine last longer than 10 minutes. You no longer have a position battle before actual one. You don't have any strategic points to conquer to gain in-battle bonuses. Enemy just rush you, even if they are defenders. Heck, I've even seen enemy going downhill to meet me on flats, while they artillery was left at the top. Not a wise choice when there are flying units avalaible. Units seem to rout too easily. Sometimes even single artillery attack makes enemy run for their lives, even if damage to the unit wasn't that great. Sure, they calm down after a while, but usually they're too late to change the outcome. Reinforcement works weird in this installment. Even if you attack two enemy armies standing next to each other on the strategic map, on the tactical one, enemy reinforcement may show up behind you. Also, there's no custom grouping, you have to group your troops at the beggining of every battle. Again, and again, and again. Quite frustrating after few dozens of manual battles.   3. Unit animations. For those who liked to zoom in and look at your little ants' fights - units swing at empty space, making enemy die from air pressure. Anime like. No collision detection, no finishing animations. Well, at least they fly nicely when they stand atop the walls and are hit by artillery. Angry dwares, anyone?  4. Sieges. You knows that walls surround a city/castle, right? It seems that in Warhammer world it is customary to attack only from the front. That's right, lads, you can't make multidirectional attacks. One or two gates, a few towers, and walls between them, that's it. To make the wound hurt more - town's towers have range on the whole battlefield outside walls. That's right, you start a battle and you're already attacked. I have no idea what kind of a general would position their troops in towers' range without any breaches or siege equipment, beside artillery. Also, AI seems to know where you positioned your troops, and puts defenders accordingly.   5. Units. Balance in this game is non-existent. Some top-tier units do less damage than mid-tier ones. Not only that, but if you make specialized hero for low-tier units, and make techs for them, they are better than some top-tier ones! Example? Low-tier dwarf artillery saved my skin numerous times. But (supposingly) best dwarves units, some sort of helicopter, are complete let down. Both anti-infantry and anti-large make almost no difference to the final outcome of the battle. The first one makes mediocre damage, and the second one miss more than hit. On the other hand, artillery is crazy accurate. I've even seen a trajectory change of a crump, hitting my unit.  6. Multiplayer. Regretfully, no comeback of Shogun's 2 avatar system. You can either play custom battles (no matchmaking through) or co-op/versus campaign. While playing co-op you can't choose the same faction.   7. Strategic map. I may be spoiled by Crusaders Kings and Europa Universalis but... This map feels really small. Sure, Japan isn't very big either. But here you can occupy only half of it. Vampires-humans can't take dwarves-orcs settlements and vice-versa. Who would like to take dwarf mines full of gold and gemstones, right? Factions aren't too numerous too and most of them feel passive, made only that main ones can consume them. Sure, I know many of them are missing, wood, high, and dark elves, skavens, ghoul kings, etc. but I'm talking about base game, not some future dlcs. Also, since I'm not a Warhammer lore expert, I can't understand why we can only choose a race and not factions within races. Are they really so different that they need an additional work on and separate sell?  8. Heroes. Although it's really fun to develop your own lord(s) and hero(es), there's one thing I don't understand. Traits. I see no reasoning behind some of them. Why one guy guarding a fortress get's -5% movement points, but the other, doing the same thing, gets +5%? And there are many, many others like that. Or there are some with general description, e.g. cornerstone. You're cornerstone of the army and are really good with supporting others. But what does that mean exacly? Wider area range, better buffs, longer duartion, all of the above? Also, you get followers for lords and heroes, that work like equipment, you put them in designated slots. But sometimes they leave you. Not die from age but leave you. And we don't know why. And two turns later you get the same exact follower. What's the point?  9. Chaos. Arch-enemy of everything that's alive. Here... It's weak. Few full stacks of not so great units. If not for their three allies, they would be a laughingstock. I've even seen AI dealing with them on their own (although, they seem to leave Archaon, main evil guy, for the player). Chaos invasion feels more annoying than threatening, since both Chaos and Norsca run from the player (AI movement cheat). But the main problem with Chaos is that the Warhammer would be better (sic!) without it. Why? Before it you have quite interesting struggle for power, you want to conquer as much as you can, but you can't really do it too fast, since you are surrounded with enemies and temporary allies. So you strategize, you plan, you put that plan in motion, you build defenses, you create new armies, etc. Every new territory is a success, quite enjoyable one at that. And soon, much too soon, Chaos arrive. All enemies become allies. All temporary allies become loyal dogs. And every fifth turn you diplo-annex your one of your race faction to the point, where you're the only one. And when the Chaos is gone... Well, you're a huge blob on the map, there's nothing that can stop you. Boring.  Enough with the rant. As you can see I've spent some time with this game. and I don't really regret them. And I'll probably spent another 50+ hours. Why the negative review then? First, avatar system could easily double or triple that time, since Warhammer seems to be perfect for it. Second, there's going to be lot of paid dlcs, since many races, factions. and territories are still missing. Maybe even more than in previous titles. If your not hyped on this game I would recommend to wait on GOTY edition. On the other hand, if you're hyped you probably own it already. Cheers!  PS. 10. No, there are no woman or people of colour lords. PPS. 11. But there are are dwarfs, anemics, and people with some skin condition making them green, so cheer up!",-1,0,0

It has a very deep and gritty melee combat system and very silly voice acting. 'CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!!' e.t.c. 'BALROG IS A DOOB!' :P The community is ok. I've come across a few ♥♥♥♥♥ (I play in Australian servers because I'm from New Zealand, so the community for that is alot smaller) but mainly noobs that just bought the game for the sake of having fun. Like me.  Pros: Fun gameplay  Hilarious voice acting  Various and unique game modes  Over the top violence (If you have ragdolls on)  Very balanced classes/ class progression  Good competition  Very challenging when you first start  Cons: Sados in servers  Laggy servers (occasionally and not very serious)  Irritating vote kick system (Hasn't harmed me yet, but people with high ping usually get vote kicked)  Noobs that constantly kill you and realise that they are doing so and yet pretend they dont so you get angry and   call a vote-kick on them. :P  Thats all the cons for me.

The graphics is 'Good, But Quirky' -Stargames (Game Dev Tycoon)  Goat Simulator is a Great Game, Except they kinda forgot to include that in the game",-1,0,0

And some skill are quite ♥♥♥♥ compare to some others at the same level.  3/ When I play dwarf, Hero(agent) appears is very very hard to see and select when next to castle (quest received). 4/ Dwarf tunnels is some where between bad and good, you can go under mountains, but you can't go under lake or just go half of mountains =)). 5/ Some big mountains just stand there for joke, you see building on them just for decor. Is this 2012 products?  6/ Some lazy workers use old direction arrow from R2, still ugly, at least they give us fast choice by Spacebar 7/ Forest there but not all forest give you hide, still like R2 8/ In my eye, Generals are ugly, no strong, no manly or maybe this is fantasy.

Plus there are a TON of ways to contribute in this team environment.  9/10 Progression is a bit slow or I would have given it a 10.

Cons: &gt;Customization menu is rather buggy and unpleasant, also not a fan of people being able to make themselves look neither blue nor red, confusing ingame. &gt;Not so satisfying xp system. My suggestion is having a menu in which you can see your chivalry profile, how much xp you have, how many kills and deaths you've dealt across all your games, kind of like the battlefield battle log, i think the devs should definitely look into that. &gt;Needs more unlockable(non-payed) weps.

You see, this game right here focuses on just you sitting in the office, just waiting for the animatronics to jumpscare and absolutly pierce your ears. Here's my take on horror. It's about the atmosphere, which I give this game does have good atmosphere. The game needs buildup, which it has but oh god why does it just have to be loud, loud jumpscares. Silent Hill is a good example of a horror game franchise I absolutly adore, what that game does is buildup and play around with your mind, tricking you, makeing you feel helpless,and hell, when the monsters actually do appear, they don't let out ear piercing screams to let you know of their presence.

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Patch 1.0 removed ancient Iris from the game which bossted the starting zone after ascension. At this time (23rd of June 2016) you have to idle for half an hour to get to a reasonable zone where upgrading is required. And after that you wait another freaking half an hour. And again. Before this patch I could ascend every 30-40 minutes to be efficient in hero soul farming to make a progress. Now it takes 4 hours. Yes I get more souls per run but it's not worth the time it is consuming. I would rather be active and upgrade every 5 minutes like it was before.   Update 24th of October 2016: Autoclicker implemented, doesn't work while you are offline, thus, USELESS.  I do not recommend this botting brown thing coming out of everyone's chocolate hole.

I'm playing a Chaos and apprently your champions are the only chaos champions that suffer attrition when near eachother. Then my vassals get invaded by the empire, who competly walk past all other chaos factions. They are at war with them it's just that the empire has a hardon for attacking my vassals specifically. OH and while the imperial factions, chaos, dwarves, and kislev are all attacking me at the same time they are all ignoring eachother even having forces in eachothers bubbles while they are at war. Then Two top tier chaos armies teleport on to the feild at the same time and destroy my starting army all on its own because im the only one who cant have forces near eachother. I like this game and I've put hundrends of hours into total war games but i've never before felt like the game was unfair and resorting to cheep tricks to beat me.

As well as it feels like it's lacking many of the mechanics that make a Total War game....well a Total War game.

You will not be able to finish this game. You will only get to play half the game or finish half the story. The fly south mission has something seriously wrong with it that there is that many undefeatable enemies. Yes you cann kill them by knife 50cal or granade if you have any left. But there is far to many. I've tried mines all over before the fight begins and perfect ammo health and flack jacket upgrades about 6 times and still there is too many mobs.

So I gather money by hunting animals and pirates, and build up a decent arsenal, crafting my ammo pouches as I go, and suddenly I realise why this game is so brilliant. It's fun. Remember that sensation, fun, the one we used to have with games. There are very few quicktime events in this game, and thank your deity of choice for that, because this game shines through it's organic gameplay. I love how I can sit an spy an enemy camp with a silenced sniper rifle, plotting a surreal fight with the guy who has saucepans strapped all over his person, only to get a pack of wild dogs overrun the camp and kill every pirate in it, the first time this happens you will probably be abit taken aback.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'm going to be honest. In my eight hours playing this game, I've had good times, and I've had bad.  But overall, I'm going to have to give this game a no.  Allow me to explain.  The combat is heavily skill based, relying on you learning how to ' Get Gud '. While this is usually perfectly fine, and I enjoy a challenge, it does not work well when most of the rest of the community has two bodies, and a spare leg and a head above you in experience.  You will rarely find other players that are at the start of the leveling tier. Why? Because most are turned away by the sheer cliff of difficulty when it comes to learning the moves of the game, and actually being able to combat people who have done it for far longer than you, of which is little to impossible.  It gets worse when most of these high level players stack on their own team, making it impossible to make a dent, and ending with the match being steamrolled.  I had fun at times, but overall, there's more rage than fun to be found here.  I cannot reccommend this game, at this time.  I'd more than happy give this another shot, if some sort of rank matchmaking system were implemented, placing you in games with people of your own level of skill. But unfortunately, even servers ment for someone of my skill level, are filled with players levels 20+, who mow down people like me in a moment.  This needs to be fixed. Hopefully, someday it will.

And I do believe there will be quite a few dlc's for the game, as it's just so easy to expand upon, so, if you aren't a fan like myself, I'd say wait for a sale, or for a few dlc's to be out, because I think this game is grrrrreat, but may not be worth $60 to some people",1,0,1

218230,PlanetSide 2,"To describe this game in just a few words: immersive and impressive yet anti-climactic. For me, it provides no closure or sense of accomplishment -- there's no way to win in this game, and that makes it feel empty. Taking over territory has no direction besides gaining certification points, which are used to buy upgrades (so you can get more certification points?). By definition, you can't really call this a game -- it's more of a combat sandbox and social experiment. If that's what you want, go for it.  It's only really fun when you have several hours to play at a time during an alert with a platoon with leadership that communicates and strategizes. Otherwise, you're stuck wandering around trying to find a fight that is evenly matched. Nobody wants to just sit there and get spawn camped when you could be somewhere else getting more cert points.   The scale of this game is incredible, but the payoff just isn't there. If you feel like you're winning, it's rarely because of something you did, and it feels like you're just in the right place at the right time. Instead, victory goes to the team with the most people.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I can neither recommend this nor fully condemn it. It's a PVP hack and slash whereby you face off against opposing players (duh, PVP) You can decimate your opponents by means of blocking, feigning attacks to get your opponent to block and then striking him as he lowers his guard. It's actually quite fun but as for re playability, it gets boring really fast. As for the quality of the graphics, they do leave a lot to be desired. One may land up rage quitting during the tutorial as it is somewhat flawed. The instructional NPC suffers from lock jaw in that there is no mouth movement when he instructs the player on tactics to overcome his enemy.  Pros:   -You'll have a few good chuckles at the hilarity of your kills. Some of them are really satisfying (I seriously didn't find many things that I liked about it. Overall it was frustrating to maneuver and felt like I was constantly trying to wade out of mud)   Cons:  -A lot of broken AI. Most times I'd find the bots running against fences or in circles. (You'd use the bot matches to get accustomed to how things work on your end) -Very dated graphics -Your character truly does run as slow as dirt. Yes, yes it is understandable that they were obviously trying to add the realism to how SLOW someone would move in a heavy full set of armor, but come on, this is video gaming.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I am Severely Dissapointed with this game, Not only is it really buggy and crashes. The game in my opinion is not a total war game but a weird attempt at making Heroes of might and magic. If you are looking for a true total war game you will not find it here  The first MAJOR problem i had was the fact that i could not conqure Dwarven cities and provinces with my vampires because 'You can't capture dwarven settlements'. Like the vampires could not repurpose the city for their own evil needs!  Second there are only 4.5 races as the chaos in my opinion isn't a full race as you cannot own provinces with them and you just run around murdering people with a champion sort of like heroes of might and magic. The four races that make up the game is basically it. I mean you can fight the britonians but you cannot be them upon defeating them like in past total war games. This game is complete ♥♥♥♥ and i would not recomend anyone playing this. I mean i had fun with it but i had no motivivation to replay it cause i know all the outcomes will be the same. past total war games i could trade and work with pretty much anyone i could play the game how i wanted to play it.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"After playing for a few months and quite a few battles, here's what I have to say about Planetside 2:   Pros:   -Vehicle/soldier selection and customization: graphics are nice, customisation seems pretty cool.  -Always players online; no waiting: because of its MMO nature, there are always teamates to play with and enemies to shoot at.  -HUGE battles: when I mean huge, I mean huge. The maps are enourmous and have varied terrain.   Cons:   -The difficulty curve: while there is a tutorial available when you first play of the game, it's mediocre at best, and does not go into depth with vehicular controls (especially problematic with aircraft; more on that later). Also, once you finish the tutorial, the game proceeds to throw you into the biggest battle it can find, basically guarenteeing you'll die in a matter of seconds.  -Poorly developed identification systems: besides the bullet and vehicle colors, it's difficult to determine who's on your side and who isn't, especially at night, in dark areas, or from a distance. Guess it would make too much sense to have character outlines or at the very least markers (the hud isn't all that great, either). Also, team markers carry over to different factions, which I found was a very serious problem in combat, and has led to quite a few friendly fire accidents (the Terran Republic still uses red markers regardless of the faction you pick, for example).  -Aircraft controls: They're horrible. Seriously. The very nature of the controls makes them ridiculously counter-intuitive. WHO WAS THE GUY WHO THOUGHT IT WAS SMART TO BIND ROLL TO THE MOUSE?! Ok, that may be a bit of an overreaction, but mouse controls should be customizable (come on now, it's been at least two years since release, and while they said they would add this feature last year, it has yet to be implemented). Also, I've been finding that the vehicle HUD needs a redesign (third person has no indicators whatsoever, and the first person view is a bit constricting, leaving tank drivers at a disadvantage).  -Customizations are too expensive and require excessive amounts of grinding to get: because it's unlikely you'll be getting a lot of kills when you start, it's near impossible to get enough certs (in-game currency) to upgrade anything, leaving you stuck with the starter items.  -EDIT: After trying this game once again, I can also say it is poorly optimized, even on high-end computers. Seriously, in battle, I rarely, if ever, get framerates above 5 FPS.   Overall: This game has potential, but it still has far too many problems for me to seriously recommend it to anyone.

570,Dota 2,"This is a bad game, it has a high learning curve with numerous arcane mechanics and controls (creep denial, activated items) making it extremely difficult to understand. The games are often decided in the first 10-20 minutes but easily go on for an hour despite that. No surrendering mechanic means that if you want to get rewards for a match you have to just wait it out while dying repeatedly, not fun. Comebacks are technically possible but I have yet to see one that didn't involve someone leaving the game, which just sucks because everyone was pretty much cheated out of or in to a win. When you get a number of kills you gain far too much momentum and can easily become literally unstoppable, which just is not fun on the receiving end. I understand snowballing is a part of the game but other games do it much better than this, where you are powerful but can still be killed if you are out of position or the enemy makes a good play. The community is pretty damn toxic, which is par for the course in MOBAs but still a downside for players. IMO, in this game fights are simply far too short, it is quite possible to die in a single second too early in the game. The visuals are okay I guess but as a WC3 player I feel they innovated far too little and it just looks like all the same models. (which was probably their goal but I disagree with the design choice)",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Why, why, why? Why did I buy this game? It looks like never-finished-alpha-version. The tutorial is so buggy that I had to quit the game and start over because the message 'Press CTRL to crouch' just wouldn't disappear. And believe me I crouched like 100 times!!! Overlapping text on the screen where you are supposed to choose the faction? Seriously? Nobody noticed before? Shame... The weapon masters usually say 2 sentences at the same time, so you can practice multitasking. How do they do it? It's a mystery. The gameplay doesn't have anything in common with Chivalry. It is about: Kill that guy in armor from behind while he is busy fighting the other guy. Chivalric it is!!! If there is a skirmish of more than 2 players, you can be pretty sure that you will get killed by the bad guy or by a friend. Because it is just unpredictable. Kids slashing their own team members and nothing happens? Facepalm... Another thing: So, I am with the red team. Great. But that guy with the red shield just killed me. Ahaaa! So it was just a freaking red shield but he belongs to the blue ones. Tricky one! So basically the point is to eliminate other players like in Counter Strike but only with slow and 'shtako' weapons. No quests, no story. Just kill them and count the kills! The Deadliest Warrior DLC added at least some cool looking characters and obviously time travelling feature. I am pretty sure that Ninjas, Pirates with pistols and Spartans wouldn't like to cooperate, so lets kill each other. This is the first opportunity to do it because they would never meet in the real world. I'll play it when I'm drunk, maybe I'll change my opinion. And maybe I will forgive... Once...",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Unplayable [Deadliest Warriors]  A complete waste of time and vulgar insult to it's father. It spends far too much time adding 'new' things that only makes the entire experience a slog. The new teams and weapons are a paper thin attempt to add content to an old formula, and the maps do not lend any sort of balance to the combat, which aside from some new ranged weapons, is completley unchanged. When the game actually decided to load you were dropped into a hellish landscape with no chance of survival.  I already have an issue with team-based games that no one fights with honor or chivalry (Whoa, wait a second) and that it play more like an RTS where the other team took your resources. Fights boil down to several people trying for the weakest in a group, if they are even lucky enough to be in one, and moving up the scale while everyone trys to fend off the horde.  I miss multiplayer games that didn't need to do anything more than let people have fun, have two or three different weapons to scissors-paper-stone the gameplay so all you need to do is be skillfull with your tools, rather than just play long enough to get the best weapon so you can scare off all the other players.  tl;dr People like numbers so 3/10",-1,0,0

Furthermore, the colours itself are hard to see - your melee attacks deal area damage and there are 3 out of 4 melee classes - it seems like you can't disable team damage =&gt; Everyone deals team damage (about 30% in average) so there are vote kicks all the time - the choice of online servers is very limited - bots are buggy.

Upon seeing him this way, they will try to forcefully stuff Mike into a empty Freddy Fazbear suit filled with componets incompatable with a human, hence Killing Mike.

Though there are hundreds of thousands of players of our approximate skill level populating the matchmaking queues, the four of us are more like each other than we are like anyone else playing Valve’s isometric wizard-’em-up.  Spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up Dota’s teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you: we’ve developed a secret language of our own, one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game. “Whack a ward on the donkletron I’m going to stick one up their jungle” is a sentence I can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people. For some reason, there’s also a lot of singing involved. It’s a lot like being a sailor.",1,0,1

Now I saw the message 'Fallout 3 is not optimized for Windows 7 and later.' Are you kidding me? Why not just say it flat out doesn't work for Windows 7? This really leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Sounds like stuff of dreams.   BUT... And it is a massive BUT... The game is buggy as f#@k. Other problems include clunky controls, unbalanced weapons, unfriendly and often abusive community, unbalanced maps with clear advantages and disatvantages (so you have groups of players swarming one or two chokepoints which defeats even the most rudimentary team tactics) and laggy servers. I tried to enjoy the blasted thing. I really wanted to. Heck, I've been waiting for a game like that since I saw 'The Two Towers' back in 2002 and thought 'Hey, wouldn't it be awesome to have a medieval FPS where you can attack and defend castles with your buddies?' That dream remains unfulfilled.    A massive disappointment is what I call this game. A bloody shame since it had so much promise. Definitely not worth the price tag. If you get it for 80% off and have a few friends to play with then maybe it'll be worth an hour or two of your time.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"I'm not normally a big fan of horror, by any category (Or jump scares for that matter) - But this one caught my attention. For me, this is not about the horror, or jump scares, I am rather immune to that stuff - But what I love is the strategy part, to learn where the animatronics are, how they move in general, how to complete the game perfectly. With that said, I must admit I also love the whole idea, both story, design and gameplay - With much of the story left unexplained, there is a lot of theories to exchange with other fans, which I enjoy being a part of. It is a very interesting game, and I have enjoyed it a lot (On my friends steam, in case you are wondering about my low play time number). I guess some might say it lack a story, and it tends to repeat itself (On another level, if you complete a night) - But I suppose it is mostly used for scaring, which (According to myself) makes the repetition fine - There is no need to make it more stressful no matter who the player is - You know exactly what to do, which makes the game more fun for a longer time. The phone calls are an excellent way of a 'instruction booklet / guide' - Not to mention it also added a bit more scare to the already creepy atmosphere - The only lack at this, was the fact that a new player probably wouldn't listen all that well, being too caught up in the cameras and doors / lights - Speaker tends to mumble a little, I would recommend listening to the calls online, instead of in game, it can get a little confusing. When you've learned all the jump scares and calmed down a little, the real game begins: Are you able to make it trough all nights simply by technic? - Give it a go, you wont regret it. A little summing up: It's a great game, the lacks it have is not problematic enough for the game to not get a good score - If you're a easy target to scare, watch others play it first, that might help.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"To see the review with pictures and video, please visit  Vox Ludicus  [voxludicus.com] .   I look upon the battlefield. The Greenskin horde, a full WAAAAGH in fact, was preparing thier assault. I had already been driven back by Grimgor Ironhide, and now he had backup. But I was not going to give in. I would take as many grobi as I could with me as I went to the halls of my ancestors.  I arranged my Dawi on top of a nearby hill, Cannons in the center of a half circle, surrounded by Quarrlers, ready with axe should the enemy close. Around them my stoutest Longbeards, veterans of many engagements and very angry. And in the center stood my general, Ungrim Ironfist the Slayer King!  The Greenskin tide sweep up and after a long, protracted battle, they wiped out my forces and wounded Ungrim. But I gave an accounting of myself: I wounded Grimgor and the other generals, and wiped out over half the forces.   This is the account of a single battle in Total War: Warhammer. I have have done quite a few such battles in my time with the game. I have spent around 8 hours thus far, and have tried the Empire, Vampire Counts, and Dwarves for races. I have conquered keeps, been forced back by rebels, and driven the hordes of the undead before me.  And I have loved every minute of it. Truly. I love a good strategy game, and I love the world of Warhammer, and I have been waiting for a game that captured the feeling of the tabletop game, but allowing me to play without spending thousands of dollars.  This game is amazing looking. You have two primary things you will staring at: The campaign map, and the battlefields. Both have a distinct view.  The Campaign map is easy to read, and while the UI could use a little work, it’s servicable. It took me a while to figure out how to read the settlement screens, building trees, and even figure out where the movement points for my armies were, but once I figured it out, it became second nature.  During battle, however, you go into an actual representation of the area you are fighting in. These can get a tad repetitive, but there is some variation. The worst for me was when I was fighting in the Greenskins’ domain, which is mostly desert. It’s very dull, lifeless, and foreboding. It gets the job done, but is bland at times.  The character models are solid and detailed. I played using high settings and was pleased with how everything looked. When zoomed out you have to use the Unit Flags to determine where your units are, and who is doing what, and I must say that on occasion the blob of units can get a little silly.  Magic effects honestly could use some work, but again, they are serviceable. Most of the time it’s muted as I spent my time using buffs and debuffs and didn’t use much in the way of offensive magic. The few videos I have seen however show them as being decent. Overall, I love the visual presentation and really enjoying zooming in and watching a mob of dwarves smash into some goblins.  Also, the soundtrack seems great. I say seems, because I never hear it in game. No, really. The only time I have heard the music outside the menu has been this video on Youtube. It sounds great! And yet it never seems to play.  The sound effects in battle however are amazing. Humans scream when taken by fear effects. Your troops shout and groan and scream during battle. The sound clips that play during diplomacy are hilarious as your faction leader says things to the other leaders. Overall, the sound effects are solid but really nothing stands out, other than the actual soundtrack not playing.  Now, be aware that all Total War games are a mix of two gameplay types. First, you have the Grand Strategy section, played out on the Campaign Map. This is where you move armies, take over settlements and cities, perform diplomatic relations and build up your research and development.  The second section is the Battle system, which plays out in the form of a Real Time Strategy game. You setup your troops in formation and then move them into combat. You cast spells, use abilities, and generally try to murder your opponent.  You can however avoid the RTS systems by using a function called Auto Resolve, but with Total War Warhammer you cannot use this for Quest Battles, which are the story battles for each Legendary Lord.  There are 4 base races and 1 DLC Race. The base races are Empire, Greenskins, Dwarves, and Vampire Counts. The DLC Race, which if you pre-ordered the game you got for free, is the Warriors of Chaos. Each race plays vastly differently from each other, and allows you to try different playstyles.  The Empire is your standard human faction, a mixed arms style of play with a variety of magic users and tech. They are the closest to a traditional Total War army. The Dwarves are slow, tough, and have no magic ability. They have some of the best ranged units in the game, however. The Greenskins need to be in constant battle and raiding as they have a stat called Fighteness that if it gets too low they start smashing themselves in boredom. The Vampire Counts have no ranged units whatsoever, but their Vampire Lords are extremely tough and they have some very fast and hard hitting units. And the Chaos Warriors are a Horde Faction, having no settlements to call their own, being nomadic raiders.  You start the game by choosing your faction, and then your Legendary Lord to start the game. The Chaos Warriors have three lords to choose from, while the other factions have two.  After that the game puts you into a tutorial fight, and then right into the Campaign Map. From there, your goal is one of expansion and survival. You have to upgrade your settlements to unlock new unit types, manage income and recruit new Lords to lead armies, then take those armies out into the world to conquer and enslave (or liberate) other settlements.  Most factions have the simple goal of controlling a certain number of settlements while also keeping the Factions of Chaos in check.  A good example of some Gameplay would be this video I did, where I started a Vampire Counts playthrough.  Difficulty-wise, the game is hard – in a good way. Even on easy, which I admittedly play on, I struggle on occasion. The AI is pretty smart, keeping their ranged units away from you, ganging up on you with reinforcements, and such.  However, there are a few issues. Offensive Magic, for instance, scales poorly. Apparently, the Unit Size setting in the options causes Magic to be a bit wonky. Set unit size to Small, and you can sometimes two-shot entire units and lords with spells, but having it on Large causes the spells to be borderline useless.  Also, on higher difficulties the AI will spam Agents, which are individual units that cannot be attacked which will do things like sabotage your army, your walls, and even outright assassinate your own Heroes. You can do the same, but it never seems to work. I had one army besieging a Castle, and a goblin agent walked up and attempted to assassinate my Hero every single turn until it succeed.  Despite its faults, this has been a fantastic release. Little to no bugs save a launch day issue that was quickly resolved, great gameplay, fantastic replayability and striking visuals. This is a game that any Strategy gamer would be remiss in skipping.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"First things first. If your gaming on a PC, you can't assume every game you buy will work without a hitch on your system. If you read the negative reviews, you'll notice almost all of them say 'game won't start' or 'it crashes'. Bad luck, your system isn't compatible. There might be a fix, there might not be. You can't review a game if you haven't played it, so don't.   Right then, the game itself.  I was incredibly excited for this newest Total War game and when I get excited for a game it usually falls a little short of my expectations. Total War: Warhammer is not one of those games.  The only cons I can find are very minor ones, such as deselecting when I try to organise formations. The pros are vast. It breathes a new life into the game series with it's unusual unit types and faction mechanics. The excitement that comes from the first battle against a new race far outweighs that of the previous games and the smaller tweaks to the real time battles, such as the deeply satisfying cavalry (or monster) charges only help to raise the bar on this incredible game. I never stop laughing as Chaos Spawn send Dwarfs flying.  Buy this game and I hope it works for you. If it doesn't, contact the tech team instead of leaving unfair reviews. Just a thought.",1,0,1

The graphics are not so intensive that a middle of the road computer is almost dying every time it plays this game. While to some that might not be such an issue that limits the amount of people that can get enjoyment out of this game. The lack of optimizing makes it impossible for anything that isn't a top-end computer. When you go to swing and your frames ♥♥♥♥ the bucket for no reason (specially when it was fine until someone swings their weapon then ♥♥♥♥ goes bananas) and you die five seconds later from people who apparently were standing right next to you, it gets quite frustrating.

You are a goat who runs around and does ridiculous goat things in a physics sandbox. That's all it is, and all it should be. It's also a great game for achievement hunters, sending you all over the levels to track down ridiculous secrets.  Of course the game style just won't click for a lot of people, and that's fine.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"The game itself looks and sounds fantastic. Graphics wise the level of detail is truly stunning and on a surround sound system being in the midst of combat really does sound like you are in the middle of a war zone. Bullets fly, explosions rock the floor. I would love to be able to recomend this game, but I can't  The main problems are that the stunning graphics and sound are NOT matched by an equally stunning gameplay or development team.  Extemely repetitive, and VERY slow to advance, this game is more a grind than a game. Tedious and frustrating in the extreme the game is unbalanced and quickly becomes a chore to play. When you have to play for several weeks in order to upgrade a single weapon you know something is seriously wrong. Because it takes so long to progress, it is ESSENTIAL to spend real money in order to get the gear you need, making this game VERY expensive to play, and effectively pay to win.  In addtion many of the players in this game behave like complete jerks. It is not uncomon to be shot or run down by vehicles driven by a member of your own team (some of which will deliberately alter where they are going to make sure they run over you).   There are also a VERY large number of people playing this game who are cheating. It is not unusual to find yourself getting killed in impossible ways, being shot when you are on the other side of a wall from your attacker, for example, and cheats such as aimbots are not unsual. The developers don't appear to do anything whatsoever to prevent this, which is probably why it is so prevalent.  The final area that ruins this game are the developers themsleves. While extra content has been added over time, the developers don't seem interested in dealing either with reliability issues or with other problems such as the number of cheaters, or ongoing issues with purchases of Daybreak Cash used for buying in game items. Finding the 'Submit a Request' on their website is nearly impossible, and their customer service is a complete joke. Should ANYTHING cause a problem with your account, there is a good chance the hundreds of hours you have put into the game and the money you have spent on in game items will be instanttly obliterated. In addition, it is not unusual for items purchesed in the game to be changed. This often renders an item that was purchased when it was absoutely fantastic, to become one that is largely useless. The developers do this frequently. The behaviour of the developers, especially regarding areas like purchased items is more in common with the kind that would be expected from a scam artist.   All up this is a game that with could be so much more, if the developers actually dealt with the problems instead of milking it for everything they can get.",-1,0,0

Well, granted, it's fun for maybe the first twenty minutes or so, but it gets inexplicably boring after a while. We've all seen ragdolling everywhere before, so watching a goat spazz out isn't exactly hilarious. I mean, if you want ragdolling, Garry's Mod is the place for that. Also, the map. For a map that's supposed to house a goat that could possibly get hit by a car and fly away, it's pretty tiny. Like, we're talking tiny tiny. Also, if you follow what the game tells you to do, after maybe an hour or so you'll end up with some serious lag. It's like, fresh at the start and dead at the end. There's no way you can reach that high point goal unless you're ♥♥♥♥in' a with combos.   However, this game isn't all that bad. I mean, the Easter Eggs made me snort a little. Also, there's a Workshop mode, so you can play other maps and play as things other than a goat, such as the Heavy Weapons Guy.  So, this game. 4/10. Take the disclaimer seriously.

The console way of going through options and interacting with stuff also affects FC3 and heavily so. I personally have raged so hard over this, because it started as a PC game and I looked so much forward to FC3. What a load of zhit. Honestly and I I'm sorry for the language, but this is completely ret@rded. Waypoints even on the hardest settings showing where to go to begin with. You have to mash space to knife a guy, and you have a feeling that the game is made for five year old kids. A hint system that is forced upon you, and while you go through it you can't do anything. All options are locked, you want to throw a stone and make some noise? Well too bad, wait for the game to allow you to do so. You need to jump over an obstacle, you just press space and your characters does it. Forget about the game engines of Quake or Unreal, where you actually could jump around and had a feeling about the world. Don't buy it and make the same mistake I did, get the pirated version and decide afterwards whether this is something for you. Money completely wasted on my behalf.",-1,0,0

In game guides have to be done in a browser because you can't make them in game, bugs are still present and the conversion to reborn was premature, little work has been going into the game over long periods of time. This has been happening with other valve titles too, the lack of attention or updates (pretty much all cosmetics are community made these days). This is the first compendium I haven't bothered to buy since TI3 because I won't be playing for a while. Overall the game is in an OK state right now, but I'm having more fun playing other games where it used to be the other way around.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Yeah, it's scary....at first.  You say 'Oh god stay away!' the first few times, then after a while you start saying 'Dammit Chica go away....! Stop HOGGIN MY POWER!'.  I personally loved the idea of this game, preserving power by keeping yourself open for attack. And jumpscares are one of my weaknesses in video games, but it started to effect me less and less as I played.   Your job is to guard the resturant at 12 at night till 6am in the morning, while fending off 4 animatronic animals that want to kill you by stuffing you into a suit. They come to your door, say hi, you say ♥♥♥♥ off, and close the door. You see them on the security cameras messing with you and taunting you. The four are Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy. Bonnie and Chica roam the halls taunting you and making faces at you through the security cameras while Freddy silently makes his way toward you after a few nights. Foxy waits at 'Pirate Cove' and if you don't watch him from time to time he will run straight to your security room and kill you.   Your only defence is your doors and lights, which apperently run on AA batteries, so you can't keep the doors shut at all times, you have to keep the doors open and keep yourself exposed to survive the nights.   When I played, I would check Foxy and Freddy, then turn off the camera, checking my lights, then repeat. I only died once due to my power running out and Freddy singing his song for 2 seconds.   This is where frustration more than fear kicks in.  I never got suddenly killed by Foxy or the other two characters because I kept checking my lights every good 7 seconds, then checking my cameras to keep the other 2 at bay. That makes you run out of power fast, but what other strategy do you have? What if you don't check Freddy or Foxy at all? What if you don't check your lights? You die. Just by not checking anything, not even the cameras or lights, after 15 seconds, I'm down 10% power.   The game failed to scare me after watching youtube video's of people getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that they lost because they actually played the game right and because of how random things are, they died.   After the 2nd day, I wasn't scared at all, I was more happy that I made it to the next night without getting killed from some accidental miss click of the lights or I checked the cameras for too long.  I only recommend this game to people who have a short time spand to waste, I beat the game in an hour and only died once.",-1,1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"SINGLE PLAYER - Nearly a perfect sandbox first person shooter  MULTIPLAYER -  The actual multiplayer is fun and fast paced. The issue? The multiplayer is so broken that it could take you literally an hour to find a game, and after one game, Farcry 3 will crash. After every multiplayer game. This is because Ubisoft chooses to not have dedicated servers and make people play through their service called uPlay. You can't play with steam friends. You have to add your friends on uPlay. You don't get steam achievements, you get uPlay achievements. uPlay is literally the dumbest thing ever and Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing Farcry 3 and not EVER fixing the multiplayer crashes and bugs. I'm not the only one who experiences this, almost every player who plays on direct x11 will deal with it. A small number of people can play fine with Direct 9x but why limit yourself so much graphical degration for a game you payed for that should of been COMPLETE. I'm never buying another Ubisoft game again. They lost my buisness and i highly reccommend you not buy any Ubisoft games if your interested in playing any Multiplayer.

Alot of the times people like the first fallout they play because that's where they made all their memories with the game. But i gave this game a fair go and i have to say the slightly minor improvements such as proper ads in NV made the game much more fun an enjoyable because i could actually hit things despite having bad aim. GOTY Edition is worth it because the dlc's add so much more even tho i don't think i can be bothered to finish the game because if i do i would still be writing this review. If you want to play a Fallout and you don't have the money for 4 play NV. If you have time to play both fallouts play 3 and then New Vegas.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I have to be real here. I get the idea of combat being the major focus of Total War games, but I never played one before. This was the first total war game that crossed over into a Genre I enjoy.  I don't despise the game, but I feel some elements could have been done better.  Pros - I like that they put vampires in. I'm pretty sick of Orcs versus Humans in everything Warhammer, including 40K. People forget that other races exist in the setting.  - The war simulation is pretty cool with massive units running around beating each other up.  Cons - The war simulation gets old after awhile. I end up just auto resolving so many fights with the AI, which I'm thankful there's buttons for it. - War controls are not clear or when actions you do matter. I had to watch you tube videos of veterans of the Total War franchise to get any idea how fighting really works. Like being able to hold keys while dragging units to move them in formation. I don't mind a tutorial on HOW TO CONTROL ARMIES! - Autoresolve uses some odd math because any battle autoresolve says DOOOMED, you'll probably win if you fight it out. Now sure why they put it? - Kingdom management is as deep as a puddle. I have more fun with other games in the genre (Age of Wonders 3 for example) that allow a bit more depth. - One world map? No random maps? Modded maps? Nothing? - I must be doing something wrong with chaos faction DLC because these dudes take forever to build up. This might seem like a LEARN 2 PLAY NUB moment, but that's what tutorials are for.  Overall, Total War fans will probably like it, I think there's better High Level Strategy games out there.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Once upon a past, I used to actually like Planetside 2, and liked it enough to spend a bunch of money on it. I realized, however, that I was clinging to the nostalgia of Planetside and the massive battles we used to have, with crazy fights over the LLU, courtyards filled with mines, doing REK Checks, granny-hacking a door because NO ONE ELSE BROUGHT A REK, holding the CC... things like this. I was holding on to it, telling myself that we'll have that back soon.  Planetside 2 is a shadow of its former self. The team is either too small or too under-funded to get this game up to fill the boots of its aged predecessor. Worse still, is how many things are broken.  The Main Battle Tanks for each faction went from requiring teamwork to a gigantic storm of metal rolling/hovering down the dirt roads, each occupied by one person who has locked the vehicle to prevent a second person from helping them in the aux gunner's seat. The tanks are woefully screwed up: Terran Republic Prowler has an Identity Crisis -- its special ability, Anchored Mode, implies that it would be great for long range shelling work. It can be. But you rarely are in a situation to LR shell anything for more than 30 seconds. New Conglomerate Vanguard has a Lovechild Crisis -- its special ability is an overshield that can last up to eight seconds, for maximum GTFO ability, and it recharges for use at a ridiculous rate. Vanu Sovereignty Magrider has a Red-headed Stepchild problem -- Magburner. Seriously? A one second boost in any direction that you then have to wait HOW LONG for a recharge on?   The MAX suits aren't much better. Should've let Nanite Systems make those, instead of each faction developing their own tech, just for the sake of balancing them, including their weapons. The specials, I can't really remark on: They're mostly okay, though Vanu ZOE seems to promote the concept of Strength In Unity. Also, the NC get shields. Again. Giant phalanx shields. So... TR are at a standstill with lockdown. NC can advance infantry from behind a wall of shielding MAX units. VS can just do their blurry ZOE thing and kill everything. Sounds legit.  The infantry game is really dry at this point. Enter base. Get people on points long enough to flip for the timer, then go hide. Kill anything that approaches the point from hiding spaces. Lather, rinse, repeat. Control Point Capture is just dull and uninspired. You'll end up just following the footzerg around and twiddling your thumbs far too often, even in an an outfit.  I've played the game for a while. It doesn't get better. The content needs improvement.  My suggestions, if Higby, et al are reading, are as follows: Bring back the LLU runs. This encourages open space battles, instead of the cramped up hallways with no doors. Stop coddling people in their spawn rooms -- I remember being killed when I spawned in Acan, in my own spawn room, by a bunch of worthless rebel scum in AI MAXes. They blew the other tubes, kept one, and used it as a meatgrinder for idiots who thought they could spawn there. I hated it, but it was a tactic, and secretly, fun. Require maintenance of bases. ANT runs, as an example. It'd also give lowbies something to do besides jumping face-first into the fray. Hossin. Searhus. Cerysh-- no, wait, ♥♥♥♥ Ceryshen.  I've given up on asking for the old ACE back. I've given up on the FDU for now.  I just want the fun to come back. :(",-1,0,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Clicker Heroes is an idle game, which means it is supposed to pretty much play itself, i.e. keep progressing even while it's not running. And while in theory it might be an idle game, in practice it turns out it isn't,  really . Why? Allow me to elaborate.  What you have to do in the game is click on the current mob you're fighting to do damage to it, or let your heroes kill it since they do damage automatically. When you kill the mob, you get gold. You use the gold to level your heroes and buy more powerful ones. When you kill 10 mobs on a level, you advance to the next level, where the mobs have more HP. However, their HP rises exponentially, as does the price of leveling your heroes. And, although the gold mobs drop also gets increased with their level, that's not enough to cover the hero levels you need to keep you going at the same speed. So when the progress gets too slow, what do you do? You restart. Restarting gets you Hero souls which increase your heroes' DPS, so in the next run you can go a little faster and/or get a little further.   However , the reason you can't just leave the game be and expect to progress is that every 5 levels you get a boss mob which has to be defeated within 30 seconds, otherwise you automatically go back to the previous level. So if you leave the game running for a while, you're going to find your heroes on a pre-boss level having farmed some gold. Then you'll use the gold to level the heroes and get past the boss, only to find yourself, after a few levels, at the same slow pace you were at previously. Your heroes can farm gold for hours, days even, but it's not going to amount to much since the cost of leveling them rises exponentially.  What it all amounts to is that if you want to have something like a constant rate of progress in the game, you will have to keep clicking every X minutes. Otherwise, your progress will grind to a halt. Compare that to a game like Adventure Capitalist where you only need to put in a few clicks a few times a day to maintain good progress and you can see how, while it may suck you in at first, Clicker Heroes will likely frustrate you with the time it demands.  TL;DR Not really an idle game, you have to keep clicking.  Protip Use a gaming mouse with macro support and use an autoclicking macro to give you a huge boost in the beginning before you get a decent idle DPS going.",-1,1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I consider this game having three acts, the first starting out on the island and hunting down Vaas, the second having you reach the second island, and the third having you complete the game.  It has 38 story missions total, so about 12-13 missions for each act. The game is also split between two islands, the first two acts take place on the first island with the final act taking place on the second. The game starts off great, I was really enjoying the first act, and the side missions were fun enough to keep me doing them. However, after a while the side missions just get boring, as unfortunately they fall into the Ubisoft formula of 'Go here, kill this, come back.' that plagues their games. I completed about 2/3 of the side missions before I just started ignoring them, and strangely all of the side missions you can do to get special animal skins to craft the best upgrades are all on the first island, so you'll have every upgrade before you finish the first act. Also for the first act you talk a lot with your new buddy, Dennis, and he helps you through learning the ropes of the island. I really liked Dennis, and by the end of the game I really felt bad for him.  The second act is where I found the game really fell flat. I quite enjoyed Vaas and his role in the game, but unfortunately he doesn't stick around until even the end of the second act. After him you have to deal with his boss, Hoyt, who has hardly even been mentioned until this point in the game and isn't nearly as interesting. Along with losing interest in the side missions, I was also losing interest with the story. There wasn't really much keeping me going at this point, even Jason was starting to irk me, as I just couldn't understand a lot of his decisions and most of what was even coming out of his mouth anymore.  However, I feel the third act is where the game really shines. The last 10 missions are fantastic, and your new new buddy, Sam, is a really fun character and adds a lot of spice back to the game. I definitely like Sam more than Dennis, and the story missions with him are by far the best. Fortunately Jason was getting a little better in my eyes and I was liking him again, and a lot of the stupid things he was saying in the second act have passed. The final few missions were amazing and I finished the game with a significantly higher opinion of it than I had by the end of the second act.  Meanwhile, there are lots of collectibles, as is to be expected from a Ubisoft game. This game seems to try and one-up Assassin's Creed by having at least a thousand chests scattered around the two islands (this is probably an exaggeration, but good lord there has got to be at least 500), not to mention 120 relics, 20 Japanese WWII letters, and 20 drug dealer memory cards to collect. As with all Assassin's Creed games, you can purchase maps to show you where everything is, then you just have to collect them.  Overall, the game is very fun despite the weak middle part. Though keep in mind that it will be a test of endurance if you plan on achieving 100% completion as the collectibles and side missions are an exercise in tedium.",1,0,1
218230,PlanetSide 2,"This is the only FPS MMO that I will play because of it's non-resemblance to an MMO. Sure, there are unlockables, levels, and an in-game store, but you really don't need to do anything but shoot the opposing faction. This game is basically a Sci-Fi free version of Battlefield.  Of course, there are some glitches in the game that any MMO has, but most of them are not game-breaking or do not really give a person an advantage.  The real fun in the game is joining a Platoon on the conquest across one of the three continents. Battles for capture points can end up being 200 on 200 and end up being really fun and long-lasting battles. The downside to that is since great action packed battles are based on the amount of players each side has, early mornings or weekdays can get pretty boring with battles consisting of everyone ghost capping points or one side being able to rush an entire continent without opposition.  Other than the fact that the game is really reliant on the amount of people playing at once, it is a great game to pick up as your primary game or even to be played once in a while, like I do.",1,0,1

With a large amount of weapons to choose from this game gives a nice variety to different situations. A leveling system that also rewards you with new available weapons and armor/color. A solid amount of maps to play and servers to play those maps in. Full controller support(be sure to max your sensitivity, trust me).   I have clocked in over 500 hours into the game because I cannot get enough of the killing, the winning and the vast amount of fun this medieval combat presents me.  Those moments when you are outnumbered and surrounded and you unleash your instinctive ability to fight for your life, kick that person, duck the first swing, turn around with a swing, chop head off, lunge towards unsuspecting fighter with s stab to the chest, turn to final opponent, block, overhead swing, overhead again... Such sweet moments. I personally enjoy using the Knight with Maul to smash my enemies' heavy armor in.   There are 4 different classes to choose from: Man at Arms, Knight, Vanguard and the Archer.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've been playing total war since Shogun 1. This is the worst total war so far. The battles don't require tactics just charge and have beefier units. The campaign map can be beaten in 5 hours (I fully united the empire on Very Hard in 1 hour so I am being an optimist with the long story of crushing Chaos)  There are so few units that the game is very bland. I was hoping for some unit customization like one can do with Warhammer, or at least chosing your own color. The Map is about the size of my bedroom and they only included one continent of the 7 or so in Warhammer lore.  I should have seen this comming with how Rome 2 was constructed, it took Divide et Impera to make the game what it should be. Also their DLC policy must be, 'let's rake them over the coals.' Because one race per purchase means that the total cost of this game to get the full experience is going to be well over $200 vs. all factions and units at the beginning of Medieval 2 for $60 upon initial release.  At least there are very little if no glitches I encountered. Go save a lot of money and go play Mount and Blade for more unit diversity and just as good game play.    ",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Played for 50 minutes. Wasn't a massive fan. Returned.  Now for the uber simplistic Pro/Con list that everyone loves!  Pros: - RPG Elements = Fantastic. - Chaos/Vampric Corruption mechanics. Love it, rewards the patient player.  Cons: - Slow. You thought Early GTA 5 had loading issues.... Oh boy have I got news for you. It takes about GTA's load time to get into a single battle. - Graphics. Eh. Much like Attila, nothing has changed and frankly I'm PERSONALLY not a fan of the art style. - AI. Terrible. Not an ounce of tactical awareness. 'Oh look, he has a bigger army than me... Let's just back up into the corner and hope he passes by...'. Better than early Rome 2 granted, but not by much. - Horribly simplistic. No loose formation, no tax fiddling, no advanced group formations, no fine adjustment of army movements like in ETW NTW &amp; S2TW. - Clunky? Hard the explain, but everything feels so slow and overburdened... - Yet fast? Again, no idea how nor why. Despite the units needing a fitness trainer and some weightwatching... Battles are all too fast. Units barely even connect before one side is drastically losing and routing.  Conclusion?  Oh I don't know. What did we expect? So many people are selling this game on the new mechanics like magic and flying ♥♥♥♥... well? That's all cool stuff. But the fundamental basics of the game are still missing or not in a good state. I think its good that CA have been able to step out of the usual boundaries and create something with a genuinely refreshing personality in terms of gameplay mechanics.  But I have a horrid feeling that CA has become lazy. Like so many other dev's who just want to pump out games and rake in the cash. Leaving the mess in their games to be cleaned up and fixed by their fantastically loyal communities.  Mods are for enhancing a game. Not fixing it...

It is also more punishing than LoL, which results it making more harder than LoL. If you are looking for another MOBA game, give this a try.

First and foremost, lets talk about MP... Sub Optimal Balance and online cheese is of course to be expected, especially with a new title. What's not to be expected and imo shameful considering the tens of thousands of times people have clamored about this issue is that pulling your internet plug during a MP does not result in a loss, nor does it result in a win for the player on the other side. It results in a ♥♥♥♥ing 'Draw' meaning every other game some 12 year old who can't handle loosing just avoids the hit to his/her stats and at the same time waste the hell out of your time. Starcraft in 1998 (18 years ago) had a FAR better system than this.  Next point, which seems to be represented in volume already is the DLC policy... Blood/Gore as a dlc? What?! Pulling a race out of the base game and selling it as a DLC from the get go... What?! Already releasing a 20$ DLC with large numbers of key units missing within 2 months of the games release.... What?! I fear that the combination of Sega and Games Workshop has resulted in a critical mass of greedy DLC...  All in all...

I was honestly never going to preorder this game after the Rome II debacle, but I decided to buy after all of the great community content on Youtube and the decision to include the Chaos Warriors DLC as free for the week after the game was released and the free content to be released. I decided to preorder a week before release date regardless of previous experiences.    This is by far the best Total War game that I've played. I've never had the experience of having so much fun that I played the campaign with all the main races- It's been 3 days since release and I've already played through Dwarf, Vampire, Chaos and just started the Orks- It's a really fun game. I'm actually excited for future content because I've had a blast. It's fun- i love the addition of the heroes and seeing them in the battlefield - they feel impactful on the outcome of battles. I would love to read up on their lore and interact with them more- this is a huge improvement on generals in the family tree. Not going to joke I become attached to them and if I lose them in a battle I reload.     The game isn't perfect- there's a couple of bugs I noticed but nothing game breaking, I think the cities sieges can be improved. I feel limited with some of the customization of my characters- I pick up a lot of gear but I'd love to do quests to build or equip and level my characters in more interactive way- would love to see them wear the cool gear on the battlefield. I'd like to customize my wizards more- sometimes they don't feel powerful at all. This would be great for a multiplayer similar to Shogun 2- I think that that concept would be an excellent add here.     I previously had no interest in the Warhammer universe, since then I have sunk my teeth into the material and I think the execution of the Warhammer universe is excellent. It's fun- it's interesting, it's unique, its refreshing, there is tons of replayabiltiy- This is up there with one of the great classic games- like Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization.

The treadmill likes to send you flying fast at 73 goats per hour. Really fast. The ferris wheel has 18 passanger carts that can hold a total of 73 goats. The cow farm, on the other hand, has many hoomanized cows, but only 18 of them rank up to kick the living sh*t out of you.  Each of these things share one thing in common. The hoomans know we love the treadmill when we place them on it. They know we cannot resist the temptations of the spinning wheel of death. They know that we must challenge the cows in staring contests in accordance to our 8th law. The hoomans are trying to control us. We cannot fall into their trap, for we cannot spare them of their desire. We will overcome them all! We will make them worship us!! Come on, my brothers and sisters!

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"After putting 50 hours of single player campaign play of almost purely auto-resolving battles due to the lack of battle tactics and micro play, here is my review.   Let's all agree that the peak of this series was Shogun 2, (Rome 2: Emporer Edition close 2nd, my opinion) this game is pathetically tragic. Only reason i continue to play is my overwhelming desire to play another Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth, obviously meaning this game reminds me of it. I was depressed unit formations were competely removed, (Hoplite Wall, Testudo, Wedge for cavalry) the unbelievably dry battles that rely completely on your ability to effectively manage your unit morale disgusts me. The fact that 1 whole unit of Orc Arrer Boyz breaks due to taking 4 volleys of quarreler fire is pathetic. I understand this title is not the norm for this company and love that they expanded their genre, but why, with all of Creative Assembly's infinite wisdom, would you remove mechanics that made the game effectively pleasing; unit formations are gone, city battles are gone (unless there is defense which now takes a building slot which is ridiculous) sea battles gone, agents are mostly gone, city building has been efficiently reduced to a disgustingly laughable minimal set of incredibly linear 2-3 tier buildings that directly effect income, tech, and public order of course, (oh and defense, can't forget the only way to defend a city without an army garrisoned).   If I had watched gameplay first I would not have purchased it.   5/10",-1,1,0

570,Dota 2,"I've been playing this game for 2-3 years now and I'm still learning a lot of new things playing new heroes. I got better since the beginning of course but there are still a lot of things hindering me from becoming better due to the people I often get teamed with. Unreasonable, uncultured, foul, uncooperative, egotistical and indenial people ruining my games 80% of the time. People like to say not to complain about others and work on yourself to get good and that's true. I can live with my mistakes and I know I do sometimes. But complaining about a team that snowballed pretty well until the mid game where every crumbled because of the refusal to get BKBs isn't my mistake when I've been telling them for 15 minutes to get a BKB and end the game. It was too late when my carries had their BKBs because they've been losing the past few team fights due to not being able to survive. Nobody cares how much damage per second you can do when you can hardly survive a fight. It's like having the fastest car in the world with no engine. Logic? I'm not a high skilled player and not very mechanical but I observe a lot of the things people do in pub games and often times my team makes the most mistakes. Primarily because they like to play for themselves and refuse to strategize and listen to the shot caller. I've been in normal skill bracket all my life since I started so I know how they play very well. If only my team is on the same page with me, I'd win most of my games and not have to waste time on a bunch of immature, fun loving (as in spoiling games and throwing), and unreasonable ♥♥♥♥faces.   TL;DR : I hate how most Pinoys, Indonesians, and Thais play. Mainly Filipinos and Indonesians because they think they know the game but they can never show it in their plays and for Thais, they barely speak a word of English so it was very difficult to communicate strategies with them.",1,0,1

Its awesome, and graphically nice made. Its Rpg/action game with essence of turnbased fight from older Fallout games. But if you have dual core like me, or more, your game will fall sometimes...even on older pc it can happen. nobody knows why. On my Pc if falls so much it brings me to cry:-D you will do better with illegall copies, because they maybe solved the problem, i played some super ultra mega edition and it worked. I am appelling on Bathesda, pls repair it for me, i love your game. Its unfair from you, Trojka games was canceled after buggy game, and every good player knows that Vampire the masquerade bloodlines was great rpg. The next one could be fallout beater, but nobody was interested in buggy rpg until it was fallout. So you made Game of year with that, sold milions copies, and the game is still buggy...DO somethink....until that pls dont buy this game, until you will be sure its working on your pc. I tried every sullution writed everywhere, and my longest gameplay was 20 minutes. And the worst part it..everybody who writes this sollution also tells you that....the game sometimes crash even if you will fix all problems...so great game..so much ruined for me...and if you anyway buy this, try my advice...dont use full graphics, its only worse, with low graphics its better...its somethink about multicores, and maybe graphic card memory setting like Bioshock 2. Maybe even Directx 11, and windows games life(it affects game dont start)..thats all, have a nice hollydays, but i bought this game to finnaly play it with no bugs, and original is the worst version....p.s. playing it without dlcs is helping.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Kinda feel like I bought a nice new car, only to find out that the tires weren't included.  Edit: Since people aren't finding this review helpful, I will expand.   TWW is actually a good game at its core, but the problem is the DLC policy. It's not OK to shave off portions of a complete game in order to sell them back to customers who already paid (very) full price. The Chaos faction's assets were already in the game at launch, but locked behind a pay wall. Likewise, Creative Assembly is charging for a higher gore setting -- something that a more scrupulous developer would add as a free update.   At some point, this game may be worth buying as a deeply discounted, 'game of the year' edition. I really wish I had done a little more research before paying full price for 80% of a game. That's my fault for expecting to be treated like a customer and not a sheep in need of sheering. As it stands, I can't even sit down to play the portion of the game I *do* have without getting angry, both at CA and at myself for being a sucker.",-1,1,0
265930,Goat Simulator,"What is Goat Simulator?  Recently there has been a lot of hype revovling around this game for its randomness and such, but is it really worth it to buy and play? Better question, will this game last you a long time, or at least long enough to get maybe a decent amount of hours in before your sick of it? For I regretably found the creul truth of this game, it's just not enough fun. There isn't nearly enough fun, wacky things to do as a goat in this game to keep you occupied. Of course, just as I did, you'll have an hour or so when you'll say something like'BEST GAME EVER!', later you'll find out it's more of a in the moment feeling. I did have a good hour or so when it felt like it was so much fun, not knowing what to screw up as a goat next, but then very soon it was evident, the game got boring. (THE GAME LIVES OFF THE FACT OF YOU BEING A GOAT TOO MUCH!!!)  What do you do in the game?  The game consists of you, a goat, being well, a goat. You basically terrorize a small(and I mean SMALL) town and do what ever you really feel like whether it's ruin a family's dinner or grab a big boulder with your tounge and hurt stuff(kind of fun). Your main things you can do are move around with the W,A,S,D keys(duh), run with the shift key, use the E key to grab to stuff with your tounge and take it somewhere(maybe out for dinner?) and of course jump with the SPACE BAR. Also as you do more things in the game more small abilities unlock like the GOATBORN, which is basically you being able to Fus Ro Da as a goat, which I admit, can be fun.  Should I Buy This Game?  Really I don't know if I can tell you the answer completly, but I may be able to push a little towards my idea of the situation. This game is is fun for only how long you let it be fun. By that I mean it's fun only if you sort of have an imagination or like just messing around with no real incentives, or goals. Personally, when I play a game I feel I need some sort of goal to push towards and acheive because well that's sort of what makes a lot of games fun. Now there are a few small 'goals' you can do, but nothing really worth going into depth like doing a backflip, but earning nothing in return, horay. So if you want to spend 10$ on this game go ahead, just remember, the game in a nutshell dosen't have much substance to it so it won't last long if you don't like just messing around.  NOTE: Also just like to note that there isn't any multiplayer, but there is a workshop kind of thing where you can doownload other people's maps, which could grant a few more hours of play.   VERDICT: 7/10 It's Ok  Pro Your a goat Gives you a good laugh Only 10$(Could also be a con couldn't though?) Good if your bored one afternoon and have nothing to do   Con Causing destruction and such gets old after a while Graphics glitch out(I realize that it's suppose to be in the game, but can be annoying) No goals or at least anything really worth striving to do  Costs 10$  ",-1,0,0

I don't know why they have a 4 pack sale when you can't even make a server with your friends without downloading third party software and jumping through hoops. This was a real turn off for me as I was hoping to play games with only my friends. Even simple indie games like SpeedRunner have better party organization than this. As for the rest of the game, the fighting is fun even though the combat seems very clunky. Everything swings slowly, creating a very awkward gameplay style when a 1v1 lasts forever with no one getting hits in.

363970,Clicker Heroes," CLICKER HEROES:  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY STILL MAKE THESE Clicker Heroes is Cookie Clicker clone no. 2646953, in the sense that it's gameplay revolves entirely around clicking on an idle object until another idle object is satisfied that the first idle object has been clicked enough. After a little while of this the game presents you with an idle object that takes arguably longer to click away because the idle object that checks your clicking has sodded of the the Winchester for a couple of pints with the lads. This game is boring. Painfully boring. And I mean literally, my left finger hurts. This game is more likely to progress your arthritis than it is to progress itself. After my 5 minutes of seldomity and boredom, I quit out (via Alt+F4 because it has no pause menu, quit button, etc) and did a little research. It turns out that Clicker Heroes is a flash game released onto various flash game sites until it somehow got ♥♥♥♥ onto greenlight, which then re-♥♥♥♥ it onto my Discover list. It's literally a single .exe created most likely using a .swf to .exe converter, if I had to guess. It's lazy. It's surprisingly glitchy. And it's given me stiff fingers.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"You want to play a game. Not just any game though; you want to play a game that will take you to a massive world with lots of people playing. A game that promises to give you an exciting adventure and make you feel happy with it.  But you heard of Planetside 2.  Its alright, however. Its a free game and by some miracle you have a computer that can atleast run this at at the lowest resolution at the lowest graphics setting at around 30fps. Technically its all good in the interstellar hood. You get the game downloaded and feel excited about the journey ahead. Maybe you will be a sneaky sniper that takes out important targets. Maybe an engineer or medic to help people and gain allies in jolly cooperation. Maybe you will be a grissled baddass of norse legend, running into combat with nothing but a LMG and pride for your made-up nation.  You decide to go the faction that is basically Space-America, because the other two are about as morally north as the moral compass of the Westboro Baptist Church. You go through training, and boy is it arduous. A whole tutorial on what a gun is and how to walk around. You also learn how to use teleporters, which are all around for an unknown reason that supports no claim to sound logistical usage.  Its time. Its finally time to get out there and not only be somebody, but kill somebody in the name of Space-'Murica. You drop into the battle, heart on your sleeve and smile on your face. Its game time. The pod crashes in the most intense fighting on the whole continent and you are at the center of it. You take a whole 5 seconds to survey the scene: a squad of your infantry is decimated by an explosion as a tank drives past you, seven shades of dropship are bringing in friendly and enemy troops, tracers are going everywhere...  Death...4....3....2...................2? SPAWN  Thats alright. You're still positive. Its just that you are new. Its fine. Your claim to fame will come. You decide to take it easy and become an Infiltrator. Hanging back, spotting high value targets, maybe taking a few out here and there. Sounds pretty sneaky. And awesome....mostly awesome.   However this doesn't last long because there are dozens of other snipers out there, all are better then you. You try every class in the game and slowly treck through every territory on the map hoping for a fight you can win. What you didn't realize is that Space-America is the worst faction in the game. They have less people and apparently don't know what vehicles are because you haven't seen a friendly one in ages. Wait...is that dropship ours? Oh thank god! Thank sweet merciful christ! Take me with you, I want to have fun!  He swoops down as if to pick you up. And then runs you over at terminal velocity. Death....4.....3.....2.......4....SPAWN  You are in dismay now. You wanted a fun experience and to get into large fights that seemed to be so equal and coordinated. Massive tank assaults, valiant infantry raids. None of that seems to be there for you. You just run from base to base as each one is taken by another faction. The enemy vehicles and infantry seem inexhaustible and the armor of both is impenetrable. There is no hope of your success; of your feeling good. You are just a cog in a dying war machine.   You go to the top of one of your last friendly bases and watch your allies march on to the front. You never did learn how to get into a squad with people. If only the tutorial had explained how to do that. Oh well, you leap off of the base and hurtle to the ground below, striking it with what you imagine would be a soft squish.  Death.....prepare to respawn.",-1,1,0

But when I got to the massive 80 vs. 80 sections where my team was laying siege to a heavily defended structure, I had no idea what was going on. I'd often die and not even know what killed me due to the killer being too far away. There was no direction, no one in the squads was any help, and overall it just wasn't a pleasant experience, not helped by the games useless tutorial.  I'll give the game props for being ambitious with its server and game sizes, but there's not direction.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"ATTENTION! MY RESONS FOR NOT RECCOMENDING THIS GAME HAVE TO DO WITH THE ABSURD DLC POLICIES. READ THE REVIEW IF THAT DOESNT CONCERN YOU   The GOOOOD 1.) The main factions are all unique and play very differently. and i have noticed very few balance issues.  2.) the map is gorgeous, if a little small  3.)The new siege battles are intense, quick, and can be challenging.  4.) the legendary lords work out beautifully  5.) EASILY THE BEST LAUNCH CA HAS HAD IN YEARS. No game breaking glitches, no crazy OP units, good job team  The BAAAAAAAD Most of the issues i have revolve around them trying to fix past mistakes  1.) In the past, balance issues have always been a problem. so, in this game the 5 (soon to be six) factions are all done really really well: at the cost of all the minor factions just being copy-pasted verisons of the main ones. doesnt really make sense  2.) Small city battles had a tendancy to get dull and repetative, due to the small number of MAPS for the small city battles. So the best fix for that would be to make a larger variety of maps, yes? NOT ACCORDING TO CA. They decided to get rid of small city battles altogether, meaning that you'll be fight out in the OPEN. This basically invalidates the garrisons for small cities. Not much point fighting when you cant tactically deploy. As such, you might as well auto-resolve, save you some time  3.) again, in response to naval battles not ever beingreal good, they simply go back to the medival 2 style, of forced autoresolves  The rest of the issues are only concerning if they dont make an effort to fix them. Leaving to reason i cannot reccomend this game:  4.) Cereative assembly is charging absurd prices already for Downloadable content. The Call of the Beastmen expansion adds a new faction to the game. Thats it: It adds everything that a new complete faction would need. And they decided to charge you 19 dollars for this. THAT MAKES THIS FACTION MORE THEN DOUBLE THE COST OF ANY OTHER FACTION. Case in point? Chaos Warriors are 8 bucks. They expect you to pay a THIRD of the price the FULL GAME was, for ONE faction. As such, i cannot in good conscience reccomend Total War Warhammer.",-1,0,0

Far Cry 3 had 'side quests' but these quests would mess up the story line and often mess up the main story line. The open world aspect to it wasnt open world at all really just a large world filled with nothing in particular. In my opinion i would recommend it to people who like a game that sticks to the storyline and just that. I would not recommend this to people who like games like 'skyrim' or 'fallout'.

In a grandiose launch, the game was already delivered bug-free and gorgeous, with stunning graphics and (at least so far) no major bugs. The FPS and optimization was extremelly well done, so one does not really need a high end PC in order to play it (of course, that doesn't mean that everyone will able to play with Ultra settings on, but still).  Lore, flavour, and depth-wise, the game does not let the its fans down aswell. Although few, all factions have diverse and unique rosters, aswell as technologies, quests and lore, making each playthrough an unique experience. Furthermore, the quest system which was added grants the game a more fantasy-like feeling, bonding the player to the experience delivered and creating a more immersive atmosphere than in any Total War game before.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"A review written from a different angle:   PROS: 1, AGENTS: In most of Total War games the variety of agents is pretty limited. Here however the fantasy setting allows to coherently include a higher variety of agents, especially imperial wizards. There are three of them. Well, some may complain that there are not more. But lets be honest, currently one has to cheer to every game that has more arcane magic users than the generic fireball/lightning-thrower. It is pretty nice that one can chose between getting support from a priest or a wizard in a single fraction. 2, Pretty nice QUESTs which do make actually sense (lore wise) and naturally include you into the story line. 3, How they included that chaos and necromancy CORRUPTS the realm of man is pretty nice.  4, I absolutely love the fact that it is not possible to CONTROL EVERY PROVINCE on the map. If the fractions are not compatible, then you cannot properly interact with their buildings. That makes so much sense and keeps the fraction's distribution stable. Also because therefore the AI does not do unreasonable stuff, like Kislev takes over the dwarfkindoms or the empier ends up in the ork lands wile Bretonia controls the actual empier. 5, I also like the fact that the game includes DIPLOMATIC into mini quests. Many complain about the simple diplomatic system. But in fact the game reacts to your actions on the map and offers you quests to chance your diplomatic status with other fractions.  6, I like the BALANCING. Vampires are stronger (which makes sense lore wise), but that comes with a price according to diplomacy, corruption dependingness,...  CONS:  1, The game ENDS TO EARLY. However there are Mods (of course). 2, The SKILL THREES are some times a little dodgy lore wise. I would have used some in a different order, weaken others... Magic using lords should have some magic-related campaign-map skills.  3, Vampire magic is a little to powerful... however... its shyish magic... you know... its a tricky thing...",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Let me first start off by saying I am a huge Warhammer Fantasy &amp; 40K fan, and a pretty big fan of the Total War series in general.  Secondly I play this game using mods, many of you may not enjoy mods, especially the ones I use, the main one being Radious Total War &amp; Radious Units Pack. I will say without mods I would probably play this game less, but the addition of mods makes this game a beautiful thing, that can grow into fruition, along with any new DLC that comes along the way.   So with that being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, it is fun, its something I had been hoping for ever since I had played the old 'Warhammer: Mark of Chaos' game, that was like a botched experiment that got my hopes up and let them down hard. This game has so much potential to grow, they're already adding more factions/units, and additional content. My hope for this game is that all the tabletop factions &amp; units from fantasy make it in, so we can truly have a 'Grand Campaign'. If you like Total War games, and Warhammer, then this game is definitely for you.      -I may edit this review later depending on the course of the game &amp; content-   ",1,0,1

My main reason for not recommending this game is the attachment to clicking, and the idea that to maximize playtime is to use autoclickers to play the game for you. I think idle games are fine in general (although they aren't much of a game to begin with), but I think clicking-focused games cross a line between game and Computer Hardware Testing Simulator.  This game might be a right fit for some people. Some people might enjoy this style of play. It's not a poorly-designed game graphically, and functionally it works how it should.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Another enjoyable Total War game and a must play if you enjoy the world of Warhammer!   The game is streamlined and simplified from previous TW titles which is good in my opinion as it speeds up gameplay This makes it easier to jump into a new game whether you are new to the series or are starting your 10th campaign. I do miss some of the variety of formations during army set up from Atilla: TW and earlier but its a minor thing.   The game looks beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent as with earlier TW titles.   The expansions have each added some new features to the campaign which were welcome and added new depth to the game. The Beastmen DLC was a little too on the nose in that they (the Beastmen) were obviously just mash-up of Chaos and Orcs mechanics. The King and the Warlord, however, was very enjoyable and allowed for playing the Orcs in a totally new way.  Overall I recommend this game. 9/10",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"For starters, let's say I didn't hate playing FO3. I've beaten it few times, did the majority of quests and even played all the DLC's. I even had fun doing that. Do I recommend playing it? Maybe. Is it a terrible game? No. There, I said it. Moving on.   Here's my main gripe: FO3 is what happens when you take a fantastically written post-apocalyptic game series and hand the rights over to a company whose writers appear to be 12-year-olds.  Imagine a world where every city, every store and every household is an entity separate from the surrounding world. Nothing has an effect on anything else. There's a town a miles down the road with a problem with Raiders? Yeah, that doesn't really affect this storekeeper couple. Heaps of radscorpions make life a living hell for a bunch of settlers living in a run-down village? Yeah, that has no bearing on this other community a stone's throw away, their only problem pertains to fixing their fertility robot. Oh, and getting their hands on a vacuum tube located 20 miles away because reasons.  When you have dozens of locations with seemingly no connection to one another or the main plot, you end up with a huge sandbox that barely resembles the intricate interconnected plots of the first two games. That's Fallout 3's setting in a nutshell. Real world doesn't work like that. If your counter-argument is 'this is a game, not the real world lol' you're completely missing the point. Fallout 1 and 2 came out years before FO3 and yet they still managed to accomplish a sense of reality - albeit a very far-fetched and sometimes tongue-in-cheek one.  Take Fallout 2, where you have a complicated, interconnected political web between New Reno, Redding, Vault City and NCR. Take Fallout: New Vegas where everything rotates around the ongoing conflict between NCR and Caesar's Legion. Everyone has a say in this, everybody is affected. Your choices affect the outcome and the ongoing power structure. That's how you write a game. And that's where FO3 falls flat on its face.  The main plot is bland. I felt like I had no reason to follow the PC's dad. Instead I ran around, doing quests here and there, fetching this and killing that, getting little satisfaction from the caps and experience I accumulated. It wasn't really rewarding. None of it. Just a mindless, momentary distraction on the road to the grave.  Oh, and the metro tunnels suck.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"If you are looking for a digital representation of the table-top game this is not it!  Foolishly I did not do any homework on the game and naively hoped it might actually mirror the way the real game works as it is turn-based - that's about as close as it gets.   Ever since GW games first started appearing electronically a large section of the table-top gaming community have yearned for a faithful representation on the PC whether it be Warhammer or Warhammer 40K...I don't think it will ever happen :(  So, the game itself is ok if you are into all that resource gathering malarky - for me Warhammer/Warhammer 40K and resource collection don't belong together - give me a full army list, different battlefields and a way to set a points cost for a battle and let me play the AI or a human opponent - simple - I don't want over complicated and frankly boring world politics. In fact, take away the army skins for Warhammer and this could be just any old turn-based resource gathering, build your army schtick.   The mouse control for looking around is awfully clunky although manouvering the units is failry straight forward. There is just too much information in the game for my liking - all I want to do it fight decent battles against the AI without the whole boring campaign getting in the way and as I have already said, no access to all units unless you research stuff and build buildings and so on, and so on...YAWN!!!",-1,1,0
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Chivalry is a well executed medieval warfare platform. Chivalry doesn't have the best visuals nor the most advanced combat however the combat is suffiecent and well executed. Like most games out there, there are skill gaps and Chivalry has one, however I'm not sold on there being much skill involved in cluster grouped fights which is most of what FFA is on small maps and smaller Team based maps. This is very frusturating as what usally ends up in the clusters in one of two things: Team killing and poeple blindy swinging their wepons hoping for a kill. All four of the classes besides Knight which is kinda boring have their moments of greatness and lows. I was also surprised at the amount of depth when it comes to maps objectives, and both handheld and siege weapons. All in all Chivalry is a vey fun game and one that I'll be hopping on and off for a long time. 9.13/10 -Bascially Skyrim with swords.",1,0,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I am completely aware of my bias for warhammer/total war fandoms in writting this. If you do not like Warhammer or total war you will hate this game. If you happen to like one of those things you will probably like it. If you like both, say goodbye to your friends and social life.  This is total war and alot of what you expect from total war(rock, paper, scissors and big battles). The AI still needs a tweak but it is hands down the best AI so far. Thankfully the took Rome II's horrible AI and threw it in the garbage. Art is great, way more immersive than any total war to date. Graphics make Rome II's graphics look as bad as they actually are. One of the things that really makes this game different is the RPG elements and story. The vanilla game I found challenging but not impossible. This game has a ridiculous amount of mods, expect alot of mod based replay.  What sucks? The price tag for the game plus all DLC is alot. One day developers will FINISH a game then give us ADDITIONAL content. This game will make you buy most of the factions in the game now. Beastmen DLC sucks, there I said it. It gives one faction and costs almost $20 and only one legendary lord. Vice-versa, Wood Elf DLC gives the same faction in 2 flavors, Trees or Elves and costs the same. Wait for sales.  If you are waiting for unreleased factions (High Elves and Skaven), keep waiting. Creative Assembly is going to make WHOLE OTHER GAMES and make us buy that over-priced peice of software just to get new maps and factions.  In the end I like the game. The cost is ridiculous and anti-consumer. The very idea that I will have to buy another $60 game to get $20 of DLC is absurd. That is why I cannot recommend this game. This game was shipped with Day 1 DLC (Chaos Warriors), a faction that is heavily apart of the base vanilla game aand should have been free. Day 1 DLC is a cancer on our hobby and the only way to really show your displeasure is with your wallet. I don't know about you guys but I am really tired of having to buy every big game twice or more.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"ATTENTION! MY RESONS FOR NOT RECCOMENDING THIS GAME HAVE TO DO WITH THE ABSURD DLC POLICIES. READ THE REVIEW IF THAT DOESNT CONCERN YOU   The GOOOOD 1.) The main factions are all unique and play very differently. and i have noticed very few balance issues.  2.) the map is gorgeous, if a little small  3.)The new siege battles are intense, quick, and can be challenging.  4.) the legendary lords work out beautifully  5.) EASILY THE BEST LAUNCH CA HAS HAD IN YEARS. No game breaking glitches, no crazy OP units, good job team  The BAAAAAAAD Most of the issues i have revolve around them trying to fix past mistakes  1.) In the past, balance issues have always been a problem. so, in this game the 5 (soon to be six) factions are all done really really well: at the cost of all the minor factions just being copy-pasted verisons of the main ones. doesnt really make sense  2.) Small city battles had a tendancy to get dull and repetative, due to the small number of MAPS for the small city battles. So the best fix for that would be to make a larger variety of maps, yes? NOT ACCORDING TO CA. They decided to get rid of small city battles altogether, meaning that you'll be fight out in the OPEN. This basically invalidates the garrisons for small cities. Not much point fighting when you cant tactically deploy. As such, you might as well auto-resolve, save you some time  3.) again, in response to naval battles not ever beingreal good, they simply go back to the medival 2 style, of forced autoresolves  The rest of the issues are only concerning if they dont make an effort to fix them. Leaving to reason i cannot reccomend this game:  4.) Cereative assembly is charging absurd prices already for Downloadable content. The Call of the Beastmen expansion adds a new faction to the game. Thats it: It adds everything that a new complete faction would need. And they decided to charge you 19 dollars for this. THAT MAKES THIS FACTION MORE THEN DOUBLE THE COST OF ANY OTHER FACTION. Case in point? Chaos Warriors are 8 bucks. They expect you to pay a THIRD of the price the FULL GAME was, for ONE faction. As such, i cannot in good conscience reccomend Total War Warhammer.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"There are so many things to say about this game, both good and bad. Chivalry is an entirely different game for experienced players than it is for new players and I have to say that after learning how to play the game and getting used to it, I have a lot more bad things to say about it than I did when I first started. With that being said, the game itself is actually really good, it just happens to be plagued with many significant issues.   The game is not only imbalanced but also very broken with more game breaking bugs than a tropical rainforest. Because of these issues the game is unbelievably frustrating at times, especially for someone who wishes to play the game competitively at a high skill level. But for what it's worth, the game still manages to be very addicting when you look past its flaws.   The way the game is designed combined with its cancerous community provides a very hostile environment for new players but the atmosphere of the game and the overall feel of being a part of it more than makes up for getting completely demolished both verbally and physically. I was having so much fun just playing the game when I was new that I didn't even care how poorly I was doing nor what other players were saying about me.  The game is deceivingly complex and has quite a steep learning curve and an even larger skill ceiling but is enjoyable enough for casual players and begginers alike. The games flaws only become apparent when you actually realize how big of an issue they are. The great thing about the issues is that they are not design flaws, and need only be fixed by the developers. With the game still being fairly new and the developers working steadily, I believe Chivalry will only become better over time and is well worth every penny. For an indie game, it is far better than most of the garbage we get nowadays and never ceases to amaze in every way. If you're into this kind of game, you won't regret buying it.",-1,0,0

If there was a server on the mars - 80% of the players would be russians. no matter where you go, you'll always face at least one c.u.n.t called 'alexander' or 'sasha' because those idiotic inbreds don't have any other names.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"First thing I want to say is that I have a lot more playtime on this game then what steam is showing. For whatever reason steam doesn't record my hours played on occasion. That said let's talk aboot the game. I loved it. I always had a place in my heart for FPS games and open world games and this brings both together in a splendid manner. The gameplay is great and involving and the best thing is you choose how to play it. You get to choose how to do things and what to do first. You could, like me, spend the first 10 or so hours just roaming the world, hunting and crafting and killing things galore. Or you could focus on the story and do side activities when resources are needed as the game becomes more difficult. The weapons aren't anything crazily innovative or creative but all of them feel different and with the addition of customization of these weapons, both functions and painjobs make using them a real joy. The silent and deadly bow, the large, heavy and noisy shotgun, the revolver you keep as a last resort, and the sniper to snipe the stragglers.  If you haven't noticed I really like this game. Another reason being the story. While most people on the internet, mainly reviewers had some weirdly harsh things to say about the story it's pretty good and the story missions themselves are rather enjoyable to play. The characters are usually well developed and they have realistic dialogue for the most part. While there are a few downsides, most of which minor, I still recommend this game to anyone that likes guns, open world gaming, or strategic thinking(especially on the harder difficulties) this game might be for you, so why not have a play?

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"The developers of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare have been killing the game steadily since launch. They have practically refused to fix bugs and problems but continued to make updates to worsen the gaming experience. The controls and mechanics have been unreliable from the beginning, and the hit boxes are among the worst in multi-player gaming. If it wasn't bad enough, they then released the idiotic Deadliest Warrior DLC for $15. Performance, stability, and the technical aspects of the game are also well below standard, leaving much to be desired overall.  Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is mediocre.",-1,0,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Bethesda should've patched this version better on Win7 or Win8. It IS a classic and has made so many revenue so you!!!  Down vote until a better patch is out.   ------------------  For now, you have to do the following thing from the link:  http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20371/?tab=2&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout3%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D20371&amp;pUp=1    ------------------  Making Fallout 3 work on Windows 7 &amp; 8  Getting Fallout 3 to run on win 7 and 8  Step 1: Copy the D3D9.dll from the “Source Files” Folder into the main Fallout 3 Directory (Not the Data directory)  Step 2: Right click on the “FalloutLauncher.exe” and “Fallout3.exe” and go to properties.  Step 3: For both “FalloutLauncher.exe” and “Fallout3.exe” right click and go to properties and set the compatibility mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3)  MAKE SURE THAT FALLOUT 3 IS NOT OPEN FOR THE NEXT STEPS Fallout 3 Config File Editing  Before you try below copy the “Fallout_Default.ini“ file included in the “Source FIles” Folder and place it into your Fallout Directory (NOT THE DATA ONE)  Manually Editing the config file if the above doesn't work. Step 1: Open up the Configuration file in Notepad in the fallout 3 directory, (Which should be named 'Fallout_default') press Ctrl+F and find the following line of text. NOTE: THIS IS CASE SENSITIVE  bUseThreadedAI=0  You must change this to:  bUseThreadedAI=1  Step 3: Directly underneath the changed line of text, create a new line and type:  iNumHWThreads=2  Step 4: Save the config file and then close. Then try to launch Fallout 3.  These steps are basically telling the game to launch using just 2 cores. This way it will make sure that the game will not freeze due to errors trying to find 'outdated' cores.  This fix will usually solve your problems, however if this has not worked and the game is still crashing then try these additional steps:  -Uninstall Fallout 3, disable .NET 3.1 under 'Turn windows features On or Off', then reinstall.  -Renaming or deleting the music folder inside the Fallout 3 folder apparently helps as well somehow?  Now it should work    GOT FOSE get it to run on win 7 &amp; 8 here Step 1: Right click and go to properties. Then go to compatibility mode and set it to windows XP (Service Pack 3) and check “Run as Administrator”  ",-1,1,0

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 is a post apocalyptic RPG which takes place in Washington D.C- This is my all time favorite game and that means a instant 10/10 and here is why:  The setting and atmosphere is brilliant and almost to good since it can be rather depressing. The world is so exciting you actually want to see everything which is good since the game has around 100+ hours ingame content and 250+ hours content if you get all the dlc. And one of the things which is about 1/4 of the score is the soundtrack.  I have spend around 800 hours in this game and it just never gets old. Even now I found hidden things and equipment I had no bloody idea even existed, and that makes me continue playing the game. While the gameplay can seem rough since its a fairly old game, the quality still manges to shine through each second you play.   I absolutely love this game so much, I am having trouble describing its brilliant content. Many people focus on having big open worlds but that usually leads to a empty feel of the map. Fallout went for density which makes the Capital Wasteland packed with hundreds (If not thousands) of things to explore.  10/10 By far the best ♥♥♥♥ing game I have ever had the privilege of playing.",1,0,1

265930,Goat Simulator,"Both a triumph and a revolution for the simulation genre. Though there are minor aspects of realism sacrificed for the sake of playability, namely the third-person (third-goat?) view, the game as a whole pays stunning attention to the finer details of daily goat life. The controls are slick and intuitive, making licking, bleating, and headbutting a straightforward matter. Of course skill will allow you to perform more complex goat actions such as mid-air flips and other such acrobatics for which the graceful goat is so well known. However, it is my opinion that the game's brilliance is most evident in the masterfully wrought storyline. You begin the game as a young goat living in a peaceful neighborhood, but destiny calls you from beyond the low-lying fence of your grassy yard. From the game's outset, you have control of the story. In true RPG fashion, you are allowed to explore the massive open-world sandbox and forge your own legacy. Will you follow in the footsteps of the great Michael Bay? Will you become a notorious outlaw? Perhaps explore the upper reaches of the stratosphere for the good of goat-kind? Will your ambitions lead you to the arena to defeat your enemies in single combat? Maybe you will become one with the darkness and serve the Blood Goat. Or perhaps you shall rise to prominence and power as the lord of all goats: The Goat King. The possibilities are endless. If you are one of the many people around the world who has yearned for a realistic and satisfying goat experience, then this game may just be the very thing that brings peace to your soul. 10/10",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"I enjoy Dota - what initially began as a way of connecting with my brother has evolved into a casual play when not conquering AoE/TW franchises or completing Skyrim for the fifth time - essentially, I continue to play Dota even after my brother defected to a second hand PS3. It's one of the very few multiplayer games I play after rage quitting RoTMG.   Here's the problem, I'm no good at Dota and after hours of gameplay, maybe I never will be. As previously mentioned, I dabble in a variety of games and like most, have a life outside fabricated worlds. I die often, fail to purchase 'necessary' gear, haven't learnt how to opperate a courier - nor do I feel then need to. The urge to win isn't strong enough to study Dota - win or lose, its been a good game if I've tried my hardest to support/carry victory. Understand I've won about half the amount of games played, half full.   I think most reading at this point are thinking - just GTFO. Its been the general response I've recieved during gameplay, and generally from team members. I can handle being called idiot and noob, even the rusty english some europeans hurl through their microphones - its harmless and almost pathetic, a laughable offense imo. I've even experienced games where team members will hang back when I've landed into danger/conflict with the enemy - and then be complained to about feeding stats, even if together we could have outweighed the opposition.  I've even been reported - its actually what spurred me to type this review, when I last logged onto Dota I was greeted with yet another drop down in priority. Admittedly, I quit the last game I was in prematurely just because I could be bothered with three angry european/american mix slinging abuse my way - instead I went to go make a sandwich. The agression this game brings out in some people makes Dota feel as if you're grinding through the majority of an hour, necessary back up replaced with heaps of swears.   Pro's  - Beautifal, intense, fast-paced gameplay. - Fantastic balance in characters &amp; roles.  - Responsive &amp; simple to control.  Con's  - A considerate amount of abuse if you're new to the game. - A considerate amount of reports if you're new to the game.  - The least helpful, most angry gamers in a server I've ever seen.

Absolutely nothing in this game is phenomenal whatsoever. In fact, Warframe is a lot more fun to play. So is Natural Selection 2. Geesh, CS is even more fun. If you want a large scale war to zip around in, have ships, have terrain vehicles, have weapons loadouts and the whole 9, you would do better to look in some other place. Think Tribes 2, Blacklight Retribution, Firefall, Hawken and Mechwarrior Online. If you want a paid game, think BF4, Survarium, Ghost Recon Online, CS GO, BF3, etc, etc. Anyway, it's free and it IS fun, just don't expect the world to crumble around you because it's just THAT good.

Quite honestly, I kind of hate it. Yet I still check it everytime I start steam up, before I play the game I actually want to play. Gotta get that gold.  [ I should clarify my 'negative' review here to repeat that this is a decent enough idle/incremental game. The mercenaries, which give you timed sidequests that help in the later levels when it takes a long time to save up for the next hero, are kinda nice. The clans are an addition for playing with friends for a while (until everyone inevatibly forgets about it because they have better games to play). Even with these nice things, I can't think of any reason I would really 'recommend' this game. If someone asked me for an incremental game recommendation, I'd probably suggest Candy Box (and Candy Box 2) or Kittens Game, instead. ]",-1,1,0

Looks like wows version, but barely even useable. Half the stuff appears to be just useless spam.  Offical website basically says they ripped you off with game that appears to offer a lot, but actually really doesn't.  'Goat Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game. It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"If you follow games at all, you already know that Far Cry 3 is one of the best, most immersive single-player first-person shooters to come along in years. It combines a chilling story, thought-provoking themes, solid gunplay, beautiful graphics, an excellent soundtrack, and jam-packs all of them into an expansive and immersive open-world that is just as fun to explore as it is to kill baddies in.  The intriguing main storyline will pull you in from the start. The main character undergoes a bone-chilling and believable transformation from a priveleged, pampered rich boy to an angry, ston-cold killer. The rest of the story is also full of complex and entertaining characters (not to mention one of the best villains in recent memory), and yet you will be just as pulled in by the opportunities to hunt, craft, kill pirates, liberate forts, and explore the beautiful Rook Island for side-quests, relics and assorted goodies that allow you to build up your skills and expand your arsenal.  The combat, while far form the only draw, is exceptional. In this open-world, the choice is yours: would you prefer to go in stealthy, set-up shop on a tall hillside with your silenced sniper rifle, or go in guns blazing with a wide variety of SMGs, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives? The shooting mechanics are very well done - the guns have a real punch to them - and there are plenty (30+) to choose from. The AI is also solid; your enemies will take cover, try to flank you, and will kill you easily if you play foolishly.   The graphics are excellent, and the design of the island is beautiful. Water ripples in the moonlight, sun-rays glimmer on your screen, bullets ricochet to and fro, and explosions look and feel powerful - as do the after-burning effects that can quickly consume a small forest. The electronic soundtrack is also great: it ebbs and flows with combat, and becomes somber in more heartfelt moments. It's integrated excellently throughout the game - you won't often be able to tell it's there, but it will get your heart pumping.  While exceptional, the game is not perfect. Exploration might have even been even better if the map was revealed more naturally instead of through radio towers, and I often found I had way too much money and not near enough to spend it on. The interface, crafting and customization options could also be improved. Still, as a whole, Far Cry 3 is a fantastic game that you will easily get 25-30+ hours out of and enjoy every minute of. There's much more that could be said, but this game is incredible value for anything less than $10, and you should really enjoy and explore the beatufiul but dangerous Rook Island for yourself!  9.2/10",1,0,1

265930,Goat Simulator,"At first, Goat Simulator struck me as being too goofy to be enjoyed. It seemed like a pretty terrible game. However, it has grown on me and now it's hard not to love it. The map is a bit small, however there are two different ones you are able to freely travel between. It takes a little time to get used to, or at least that's how it was for me. Once you discover how many different little things are in the game, it becomes hard to not want to play mroe to see what else you can find/do. For example, you can ride a bicycle, which is actually kind of difficult to balance on. You can also ride longboards and a bunch of different rides, like a roller coaster, ferris wheel, and things like that. Your goat can even eat shrooms (if you can find them.)  All in all, this game is pretty great. It might strike a lot of people as too silly and maybe like it is designed for a more immature crowed, but give it a chance. You might end up really liking it.   I should add that I have played it on more than one OS on the same system. The game runs horribly choppy when I run it using windows 7, however on that same computer it runs much smoother on Ubuntu 14.04. However, there are a few bugs when running on Linux because I don't think they're completely done with it. For example, it will freeze when traveling between maps.",1,0,1

Then they just whip out a lightning fast, unblockable dagger and stab you to death.   This is Chivalry: Archer Avoidance, in a nutshell. Run to a fight. Get sniped by archers.

319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a clever concept with a unique theme, but whether it's a 'horror' genre game is debatable. A thriller maybe, but there is a distinct lack of gore or much sense of the macabre, and it has a distinct tongue-in-cheek quality to it. Unfortunately, that tongue is haunted! *WooooHooooo!!!!!*  You play a newly hired night watch person at the Chuck E. Cheese-esque establishment. Your job is to man the cameras and make sure the animatronic characters, who roam around at night, do not make it into your control room. You can pull up a laptop to view stationary cameras set in various rooms, operate door switches leading into the office, and operate lights outside the office. You are limited in how much power you have to utilize all these electric devices, and thus it becomes clear what the game really is: a resource management simulation in an apocalyptic world where there is no power grid.  There are some genuine jump-scares, initially. The longer you play the less sensitized you become to it though, because there isn't enough variety in the 'attacks' that happen. There is some dread, or defeat, you feel when in the last hour or two you realize you do not have enough power left to make it to the morning. Each night gets progressively more difficult to make it to the morning, because the animatronics become more active and you are forced to use more power. I guess, ultimately, this has to do with your boss being a penny pinching miser (just look at your paycheck at the end of the game!). There should be an expansion to this where you become part of a class action lawsuit with all the other Five Nighters to collect for withheld pay, physical pain, and emotional suffering.   As you become more proficient at the resource management they throw a twist at you in the form of 'Foxy' - an animatronic character who can run and will sprint down a hall into the office. You can close the door, if you're quick enough, but you still lose. You lose because every time Foxy gets to the closed door he bangs on it - and when he does it depletes 6% of your precious power. If he does this 3 times in one night - that's 18% of your power! *screwed*  I give props for the originality of the game itself, but the execution leaves something to be desired. Hitting ESC, for instance, doesn't pull up a menu screen or pause the game as it does in 99% of PC games. Instead, it quits the game. No problem, because the game saves what night you were on last. Great! What the game doesn't do is provide for more than one game file, so if you accidently click 'New Game' instead of 'Continue' it wipes your game file. *son of meat packer!*  I like the concept, but I'm tired of being r@p3d by robotic automatons.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"CORN FOR THE CORN GOD BRAN FOR THE BRAN GOD  This is my first review of a total war game but I have been a huge fan of the series since Shogun 2. I've played hundreds of hours of Rome 2 and Shogun and found them to be some of the best strategy games I've played. I am quite aware of the sleazy practices of SEGA and their DLCs and botched launches but CA has seemed to do their best to make their products as good as they can given their publisher constraints. Given this, here is my review of Total War: Warhammer   Performance   Warhammer is the most solid Total War release since Shogun 2. The game runs well on most systems, it doesn't have a plethora of crippling bugs, and it is low on broken game mechanics. I don't have the most powerful system but I've played 60 hours so far and haven't experienced any major performance issues. This is extremely refreshing after the almost unplayable releases of Rome and Atilla.   Campaign Gameplay  I am by no means a fan of the Warhammer universe. In fact, in the past I've actively hated on Warhammer and its fans. So I was not terribly excited when Warhammer was annonced. However, after playing as 3 of 5 races in the campaign I have found that the fantasy setting breaths a lot new life into the Total War model. The greatly exapanded RPG elements of customizing skill trees and renaming units and characters creates stronger attachments to characters and increased the immersion in the game. The dangerous monster units, lords, and heroes add some exciting and interesting new tactics to the game. The presence of these units also makes the AI much more dangerous and fun to engage with. This is perhaps my favorite new feature. The AI in this game is as devious as ever and will actually present a significant challenge during the campaign. Conflicts with factions often last much longer than previous titles and the armies that you encounter are much more high tier. This is opposed to most other Total War games where the AI would mostly wander around with stacks of terrible units and beating them usually only took a battle or two. The improved AI armies and tactics mean fights are much closer and allow wars to actually feel like a intense campaign instead of a border skirmish. This is so refreshing for a title I was worried was getting repetitive and the biggest plus for me.   Multiplayer Gameplay  This is the part of the game that I feel is the most negative. The multiplayer model is essentailly the same as Rome 2 and Atilla. The quick battle and custom battle are the only options for competitive play and there is no progression system. For a game that introduced a fun new skill system with heroes and lords it is disappointing that this wasnt transferred to the multiplayer. Custom Lords and Heroes would have made multiplayer a much more engadging experience. However there are some positives. The different races interact with each other in ways that are much more interesting that previous titles. The diversity of units and army compositions that one can experiece in any given fight adds a lot more depth to the strategy and makes developing good builds more challenging. The addition of more races will only improve this. Also, the multitude of maps are well designed and there is a lot of variety in the terrian, making for diverse engagements. Its a solid system but there was a lot of potential to make multiplayer a stronger aspect of the game.   Design  While I am not a fan of Warhammer, the art design of this game is absolutely gorgeous. The map is full of fun landmarks that are visible on the battle field, the units are beautifully animated and designed, and the UI is clean and well organized. The impacts of the larger units are epic and the engagements are cinematic. The production value of the title is truly a step forward for the series.  Overall Takeaway   A beautiful, engrossing, and well performing title that breaths new life into the Total War title. There is easily 100+ hours of good content in the campaigns alone. Multiplayer is fun but the lack of innovation is disappointing. All things considered it is a great new title and I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys the strategy genre.   Score  8.5/10",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"It's a good idea, and the best in its genre - but still executed poorly and  will have you saying 'that was bulls-' every 2 minutes . It's not fun anymore.   The meta-game has just devolved into who can cheese and exploit the mechanics the most ... for example; landing overhead attacks instantly by turning around, ducking, and looking up - so that you catch them on the backswing.    Combat with multiple people just doesn't work , which is surprising for a  multiplayer  game. Teammates will hinder you more than help you, and you will end up hitting your own team (or they will end up hitting you) by accident. Movement is too sudden, so people will instantly appear infront of you. It makes using heavier weapons more punishing because you're more lethal to your team.   It feels like a waiting and running simulator  with the 10 second respawns and the 30 seconds of running to get to the fight - just to potentially die instantly when you get there - having to do it all over again. Even worse if your teammate ran into your weapon, making the respawn longer   The latency compensation is horrible , so good luck using any short weapons like the double axe. It's impossible to hit someone who is running away from you with this weapon.   The community is rancid , as you will get attacked by your own teammates if you choose an archer. If you choose to defend yourself, you will get kicked for doing too much team damage.  Chivalry does have its cool moments, but they're very few and far between... you spend most of your time just waiting for a cool moment to happen, like popping 3 heads in the space of 5 seconds. But then your teammate will jump in and catch you on his back-swing so you stagger, then whilst you're staggered, you die.",-1,0,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've been a fan of Total War since Shogun 2 came out, I've also gone back to old games to buy them such as Medieval 2. And when they announced Total War: WARHAMMER, I was hyped. Big fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Scene, and when two of my favorite games mold to make one. Makes me a pretty happy camper. Now I saw the day-1 DLC and was disappointed, but what do you know CA goes and says 'Nah fam, you buy our game within one week *actually more like two* you get the Chaos Warriors free'. So that was a great move on CA's part. Blood and Gore DLC for 3 dollars, that's been happening for a while now and makes perfect sense to me. Have the game with no blood for a lower rating for more copies to be sold to younger people, than a month later come out with the bloody stuff so that the older fans can enjoy a higher rated game.   This beastmen DLC going on however has me a bit ticked. Now I understand not every faction can have all their cool and unique units, but the Beastmen roster is already so small, that removes two or four units is basically almost cutting it in half. Now I'm disappointed in the size and the price, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a good size. CA is adding the Beastmen to the grand campaign as foes REGARDLESS of us owning the DLC. That adds more ♥♥♥♥ to the game regardless, not to mention the new stuff we're getting from Update 2.   Now what has me really scared is the Skaven, my number 1 favorite faction, getting their roster slashed a bit. If the new major factions in the coming expansions and DLC have a smaller roster than the 5 Major factions we have now. I will be very disappointed and angry with CA. But that's another story in general because you are wondering one thing.   'Red, why are you telling me all this ♥♥♥♥ but you recommend this game?'  BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT GAME. Sure it doesn't have nearly as many factions as other Total War games, but be honest how many of those factions were even remotely different? Each faction in this game has unique mechanics, heroes, leaders, and units. So yeah I recommend this game, do I recommend the DLC for this game? That depends on what you consider a good deal. For some the DLC is a no go, for others its a great deal.   EDIT- The purpose of this review was less about the game in general, but more about how people are ticked off and giving the game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bad reviews when they aren't upset about the game they are upset about the DLC.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I've played this game for a bit now, I've also been in the competitive scene, and I must say that this game is pretty bad. Sure, this game seems pretty cool at first, the cool dismembers, and the awesome combat makes this game seem very fun. But, after you see all the unrealistic forms of fighting, you soon come to learn them and use them against people and it seems as if the game becomes not what it should be. You do full 360 spins, 180 spins, you exploit the game of it's many glitches that the developers don't fix. That's another thing I must say about this game; the developers are just so money-hungry. They do not care about the community, all they care about is money. They only release REAL gameplay changing updates about ONCE A YEAR. That is not acceptable on any terms, ESPECIALLY since the developers are making ANOTHER game, so that shows that they didn't give up, they just want money. Sure, you can say that they were working on their new game the entire time, but you can't tell me that you can't take the time out of your day and just listen to the community of this game, and fix what needs to be fixed. Oh, but don't worry, the developers DO release other updates throughout the year. They release one update about once a month, but it's not anything involving gameplay changing. It involves FAN ART and WEAPON AND MODEL SKINS THAT ARE REALLY OVERPRICED. There isn't any steam market for the game so that other people can sell their skins for what they think is worth. But no, the developers only care about money, so they force you to pay them directly for the overly priced skins that just make your character(s) look fancier. There isn't much to this game other than hack and slash. Also, the game has a very low population count, so all the servers are filled with the same 100-200 people that you see on a regular basis, and I'm being generous with the 200 people, I feel it's 100-150, but I've only been on the NA servers. I do NOT recommend this game for anyone, and I do NOT look forward to their next game. If you are looking for a medieval combat game, there is a game called Mordhau. It is not released yet, but there is one trailer out, and with that one trailer, the game looks twice as good as Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. I repeat, do NOT get this game! It's a waste of time and money.",-1,1,0

It's fun at first with the carnage and all, but you'll smell the BS pretty soon, and eventually see how incredibly unbalanced and bug-ridden this game is.  I can just hope that another company is going to make a professional, balanced and working game like this. You know, a developer that doesn't declare a game-breaking exploit (dragging) a feature instead of fixing it, or makes DLC while in BETA. DLC that of course is similarily unbalanced and bug-ridden, of course.

It is a game where you pick from mostly 'mythological' themed heros and battle in a little war, 5v5 against other player controlled heros. Its won by destroying the enemy's main base which is protected by towers.  You fight the other players as waves of minions from your allied forces and your enemy's forces clash in 3 lanes. Killing enemy players and minions, either in the lane or in the forest gives you gold to buy items. Items like Manta Blade let you create multiple illusions that deal damage, Shadow Blade lets you become invisible, and Ghost scepter makes you etheral.   Hero examples are Dragon Knight who is a knight that transforms into a dragon and breathes fire, A giant Treant that roots enemies in place and steals their health, a Stealth Assassin that has permanent invisiblity and uses smoke bombs, and an undead Lich that casts frost magic.",1,0,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I bought this game back somewhere between late 2012 and the middle of 2013. The combat was excellent; probably one of the best melee systems I've seen in a game - and that was only bolstered by the fact that the gore was brutally fantastic. It was ineffably satisfying to hack someone's arm off with a huge, heavy two-handed axe and then come back around with another swing while they're still clutching at their socket and take their head off. Combat was heavy and precise, the maps were cool, and the music was pretty good. So why am I not recommending it?  You'll remember I bought this game late 2012-mid 2013. Basically nothing has changed about this game since then; there's been a few miscellaneous tweaks and fixes, but there's nothing  new . No new maps, no new weapons, no new music; they never fixed the fact that you can't change the time limit on your own dedicated server, so you have to deal with the map trying to switch itself every ten minutes. Also, something changed about the combat along the way; I can't exactly pinpoint it, but it doesn't feel as fluid and responsive as it used to.  At some point they decided to stop making big, important changes and additions to the game and start implementing new helmets, and new armors, and new weapons skins. Cool! So what's the catch? The catch is that you absolutely cannot acquire   any   of these by legitimately paying the game. See that fancy helmet? That'll be $5. See that cool skin for your zweihander? That'll be another $5. There's so many microtransactions in this game that I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible to drop over $100 on all this superfluous, superficial stuff that doesn't really make a difference to the overall experience. I understand TB has to make money, but there should be much more to every update than just more skins you can purchase and a few tweaks - it's pretty ridiculous at this point.   It's sad to see the game go this way, as I made some great memories with this game and enjoyed the experience, and I'd say I got my money's worth; but I'd probably unbuy it if I could. They even put out a Deadliest Warrior DLC, and I abstained from buying it since I knew it was just going to be abandoned as well.  If you're new and you're reading this review and you're considering purchasing this game, I'm not here to dissuade you. Chivalry is an excellent experience and still has some of the best melee combat I've ever seen in a game, and I've definitely had my fair share of good times with it. But if you're buying it and you expect the current core experience to grow and evolve, absolutely do not buy this. It hasn't changed in the past two years, and I suspect it never will.",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Awesome game, very solid gunplay and feel. It reminds me of Far Cry 2 in that you could take over a base guns blazing, or with stealth. Though you get more XP and its just way funner to take the stealthy approach. I've yet to try Multiplayer/Co-op, so this is just a singleplayer review.  I do wish weapon wear was still in the game. By that I mean the weapon starts to jam/rust over time after using it a lot. This was good to keep you from just picking up enemy's weapons and not buying them, as their weapons start out in pretty bad condition. Of course the problem with this in Far Cry 2 is that the fast travel sucked, and getting to a base/gun shop to replace yout weapon was tedious, but now that fast travel has improved, I see no reason why that feature wasnt re-introduced. The way you can get free guns in the game also made it a bit easy to be very OP very quick.   Also the storyline was nothing to write home about, it was very cliche and really poorly written, although Vaas was a cool character, we kinda got 'spoiled' with the trailers of the game, they just showed all the good parts of him in the trailers.   Other than that, awesome game, I love the Far Cry series. The stealth is fun, and the open world element of the game is flawless. Spend your money on this game. 9.5/10",1,0,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"'Far Cry 3' came out a few years ago. It's an open world FPS, with some roleplaying elements, like weapon upgrades and skills, and a rather strong emphasis on story and characters, although at the cost of some interesting side mission. The game is all right : the main problem I had with it was that it uses 'Uplay', that it's a console port and thus badly optimized. I apologize in advance for ranting way too long about those part, and not talking more about the game. To me, these two parts are tied together, and I cannot just ignore the flaws of 'Uplay', especially if it has repercussions in the game itself.  'Uplay' is similar to Steam, except worse in every regard. That it is necessary to launch it, and Steam, at the same time, for copy protection reasons, shows just how much Ubisoft actually cares for a user friendly product. That it is slow and unhandy would be the core of my gripes with it. That it actually taints the game is unforgivable. Since the inventory menu in 'Far Cry 3' is in the main menu of the game, and said menu needs to check online with the servers for whatever reasons, it can take ages to do want you actually want to do in-game. That is not a correct way to proceed. Why can't I check my inventory if Uplay can't connect to the servers, although it could when I launched the game? Is it because I played during the release of 'Watch Dog'? Is it really possible that, because of the launch of another game overloading the servers of Ubisoft, I couldn't check on my inventory in Far Cry?! That's insane! Yeah, how can you even try to get some immersion going...  Oh, as a side note : I already had an Ubisoft account, before using Uplay, but I couldn't login with it using Uplay. I had to login through their website first, and then login through Uplay. Obviously Uplay never bothered to tell me that, only that my internet connexion was down and that the fault thus laid with me. Thanks. Very helpful, and user friendly once more.  It connects when Uplay launches, it connects when the game launches and it connects to the servers when you open the main menu of the game. Because of the poor optimisation, and my wish to tweak the game as best as possible, these logins delays were a serious pain. There are troubles with SLI, and even crossfire apparently, even though it's an AMD game. The stuttering with SLI was finally resolve for me by using a third party program. Still, sometimes the game just bugged out and only one card out of the two actually worked (first time that ever happen to me), requiring yet another time wasting restart of the game. The graphic options menu leaves a lot to be desired. It's impossible to remove motion blur or ambient occlusion (which makes the game look worse in my opinion, and even cost more resources). You need to tweak that in the game files, and even then bugs appear, like sound bugs (how does a graphic option affect sound?!) But the worst offence? The game doesn't even look that good for the resources demanded. 'Crysis', -the first one!-, which came five years before, looked way better in every aspect. It's even better if you take into account the fact that in 'Crysis', the game world was more interactive, and destructible: you could mow down trees and blow up sheds. Not so in far cry.  The game itself can be shortly describe as an amalgamation of 'Skyrim' mixed with 'Just Cause 2', except it leaves the best part of those games at home. 'Skyrim' had lots of different looking environment, and different cities with their respective style. 'Just Cause 2' had a very insane gameplay, which was quite fun, but repetitive. In 'Far Cry 3', the game world is quite small, which is probably for the best since repetition already sets in as it is. Secondary quests aren't that good, though the main plot is quite interesting. It reminded my of Hotline Miami : a descent into madness and mayhem. The gameplay is that of an average FPS : aim and shoot, although it can be pretty “organic” in Far Cry, with multiple approaches on how to overtake a stronghold. It sadly doesn't work that way during quests, either secondary or principal. You will often fail an objective because of unclear restrictions or arbitrary limitations, which is stark contrast with the free-roaming experience. The characters are interesting enough even though I don't know if there are one step short of being campy or so insane that they transcend such definition. The tone of the stand alone, 'Blood Dragon', shouldn't be a surprise as the path visible here already alludes to such extravagance. The endings could use a lot more polish thought: they are just too easy and don't amount to anything. It's just a quick wrap up. There are worse endings out there, but you could have taken more than ten seconds to come up with one, surely.  As it stands, I'm glad to have played, but had I known before hand how horrible Uplay is and how poorly the game runs, I wouldn't have bothered. If you lack the patience and tolerance for such nonsense, I wont blame you and you wouldn't be missing out much regardless.",-1,0,0

363970,Clicker Heroes,"Patch 1.0 removed ancient Iris from the game which bossted the starting zone after ascension. At this time (23rd of June 2016) you have to idle for half an hour to get to a reasonable zone where upgrading is required. And after that you wait another freaking half an hour. And again. Before this patch I could ascend every 30-40 minutes to be efficient in hero soul farming to make a progress. Now it takes 4 hours. Yes I get more souls per run but it's not worth the time it is consuming. I would rather be active and upgrade every 5 minutes like it was before.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Bought this game because of two reasons, I love the total war series and I (used) to love Warhammer.  I said used to love Warhammer because games workshop killed the fantasy world off over night, a lot of investment canned and no longer supported, what a waste. Now the total war series has been invaded by the Warhammer world, an old pet hate has arisen, the cost. The price tag for such an army to be competitive was a lot of investment, to play an army in total war is Beginning to become the same, Beastmen I have just seen been released for £13.00 for pre-release, I have already paid £47.99 for core package and chaos + blood. I feel like this is a humungous cash cow for saga and games workshop, have I brought an unfinished game for a finished game price, only to have to pay up for the left out content.

218230,PlanetSide 2,"I did like the game at first. When i got to know most of the things in the game i finaly realised how bent this is on money grabing.  Constantly getting killed by cloakers with assault rifles or 1 hit kill bolt rifles, tanks, aircraft you name it.  Imposible to hide in the game due to beacons, radars on crafts and vehicles.  Everyone you shoot has implants of lvl 3-4, items for all classes are 99% absolute ♥♥♥♥ due to absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balancing. But all rifles are LAZER ACCURTE .... And so on. Reason it absolutely sux is because you always play against lvl90+, lvl 100 and lvl 120 who has ten times better gears than a noob like you. Good luck with the grind, or pay real cash. Money earning in game is beyond ridiculous painful strain, 1 credit for 3 player kills, barely noticable amount you can get for any other activity UNLES you ATTATCH YOUR BANK CARD to the ♥♥♥♥-shop and sub for monthly pays and on top of that , oh yeah, pay more cash with pay pall and buy the ♥♥♥♥ing boosters for a fortune.  Oh dont even get me started on 'the lab' wanking fest where you shoot ONLY if they come out from a spawn forcefield and they shoot you from inside no problem ..........  In my view, game is over 2 years old now and is obsolete. Faction balancing is complete absurdity and any fight you simply win with biger player count.

When i finally got into the game i started playing a campaign as Empire, my first battle was a mixed experience, sure the unit detail is nice as always and the heroes with 3d portraits is a nice idea, but the battles still feels off like something is missing like blood and gore, limb seperation and decapitations.

Idea is great, but the AI in the game is beyond dumb and the HUD is cluttered with things you dont really make use out of. Campaign is ever so much like CIV mixed with the old Total War games.  Being such a big fan of Warhammer I am disappointed that it doesn't live up to it's raw and brutal nature, even though the showcases and trailers by the developers were great. Maybe they will patch it to make it better, maybe not.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game will only get better as time goes on, because it was not finished at release.

It was not R2 bad on release, but there is still a startling amount of bugs. When they are reported they are tossed into the bug forum (AKA the graveyard) to be ignored.  Each title CA releases feels like they give less of a ♥♥♥♥, and is more about cranking out DLC before the base game is even complete.  BASE GAME Rev @ Launch 6.5/10 Blood and Gore 9/10 Grim/Grave 4/10 Warlord and King 10/10 Beastmen 3/10, this was a complete let down, the 'narrative' campaign was not worth even playing.

570,Dota 2,"This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The only reason you should get this is if you want anxiety problems and severe anger issues. My winrate may be around 50/50, but in a ratio of decent matches and good matches to a 'normal' match (which is not good) is probably 10/90. I have never been in a game where: -Everyone speaks english on the us servers -Someone willingly supports and buy wards, courier, and doesnt take all the kills on purpose -Someone abuses their mic with loud and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music Also someone disconnects every other game and usually dont come back.  AND dont even get me started on ranked. You expect it to be better, like getting a phone upgrade. NO. The enemy team picks axe and meepo, and you lost 8/10 starting matches. My starting MMR was 1200, and even after like 50 more ranked matches it hasnt moved. 1200s. There is no cooperation in this 'teamwork' game, and people rarely communicate. After a while I installed League of Legends, and it was really easy compared to Dota. Turns out it was, and everyone who has played both MOBAs agrees that Dota is more difficult and complicated. I still play both but the only reason YOU should get this game is if you want to get a head start for League. Not saying that it is better; both games and pros and plenty of cons, but Dota has more cons in the community, not the game. Everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ (including me) and probably the harshest group of people ever. Imagine Call of Duty with only 10 year olds, but with less racism and they cant speak english. Overall, this game gave me cancer, and you shouldnt play any MOBAs. Just get some indie games or any other Valve games, but after you read this you'll probably end up watching somone else play games on Youtube.",-1,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"The pattern of 'streamlining' for casuals continues. Sieges are very arcadey deployed right into tower range for example, unit formations are gone, group formations are limited to a couple of options. I don't know if modders will be able to crack these issues, if they can then that's my only hope. In the meantime I'll probably go back to the excellent EB II mod for MTW2. Earlier TW games had much more detail and more options overall with the exception of ship combat for Shogun I, MTW I, Rome I, MTW 2. The series has continued to be simplified more and more which is pretty devastating to people who played the thinking part of the series. The TW series in general has had issues with AI whether CAI, BAI, or DAI, but little has been done to improve it over the years. The focus seems to be more on a cinematic immediate gratification fest rather than a thinking, methodical strategy game.  I was really hoping (I should have known better) that CA would return to their roots in terms of the combat at least, but I was sorely disappointed. No open city fighting either as far as I can tell (or naval combat for that matter). I feel like this is just the way things are gonna be as the series is concentrated on simple accessibility with a lot of flash but less and less substance. I won't say the game isn't fun at all, but knowing how much better it could have been if it was actually designed as thinking man's strategy game.   Since Rome 2 the series has felt like the strategy version of CoD in a way. When I see what modders have been able to do with the EB II mod for MTW2 compared to the simplified systems implemented by CA since Rome 2 it's obvious at this point that what sells is simplicity. If I sound enraged it's because this was one of my favorite franchises (as well as my youngest brother's btw) but since Rome 2 the direction of CA is now overwhelmingly clear; cater to the casual because it makes $$. Can't blame them from a business standpoint, but considering the strategy games I grew up with I have to wonder if it's a generational indicator of where we are now (which makes me want to watch Idiocracy).  To reiterate, I'm not saying the game isn't fun, I'm just saying it's very, very arcadey and even more so with gutting of tactical options (sure they added magic, but meh that's not really a big deal vs unit tactics/formations.  I still play MTW I, Rome Total War I, and MTW2 on a regular basis. The amount of detail that went into those games AT THE TIME they released was indicative of significant TLC and catered to a different kind of crowd that liked options, detail, traits, etc. There is no such corresponding effort from CA since Rome 2 and this latest entry is no different in that respect; accessibility over substance, simplicity over detail, limitations over options.  For a Warhammer (as opposed to old guard TW) fan it is worth it, especially if you never played the other TW games WHEN they came out (if you're like my brother and I anyway and want it all: tactical options, improved AI capable of executing sieges with MY OWN planning, etc). Shogun 2 I would say was the last total effort by CA. You can have fun with this game, but I could not in good conscience recommend it to the old guard.",-1,1,0

I'm sure they did their best, but there's nothing rescuing the lackluster quests, story and dialog. The writers failed this game.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Don't bother wasting your money on this game. Only reason I did was because during the promo it was $5.00  Basically the games idea of medieval combat is great, at first when you first start its awesome while you're learning the basics. Once you get even remotely decent at the game you're experience drops drastically and you realize you wasted money.   Boils down to the games development team was lazy, and didn't take the time to place effort into making a smooth running combat game. The maps you constantly walk around glitching unable to turn a corner that is wide open. Jump through a window with PLENTY of space and ledge. Or the most common one is going up ramps up castles you can't turn the corner without swinging the turn like you're a semi truck. The collision setup of character models is so poor it alone is a frusterating challenge. And then to top it all off. Game lags during combat during the bigger maps bad because the coding for the encounters is poor.  If you like walking around stuck on everything, and unable to land blows even when they are dead on shots, and you're dying all the time. This game is for you. Otherwise if that sounds like a terrible experience. It is...",-1,0,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is an open world first-person shooter published by Ubisoft Entertainment. It is the next installment of Far Cry series after Far Cry 2.  Far Cry 3 gameplay, it has open world, it has small RPG element, and it has one of the best villain character ever. In my opinion Far Cry 3 open world feature is almost similar to Assassin's Creed where you have to climb a radio tower, interact some sort of panel to explore some area on the world around the tower. In Far Cry 3 you don't just get to shoot somebody and run. You can buy and upgrade weapons in store, level up getting new tattoos which conveniently giving you new abilities such as walk faster or something, also, there are some upgrades that require you to hunt for animals hide or plants. The best part is, when you shoot a tiger, it will fight back! Let your guard down and a leopard will eat you. Got bored? Maybe you should go to a village and play some poker games and rob those poker players. Do you want to become Hawkeye? Legolas? or maybe Rambo? Use explosive archer and blow some goats. Got angry? Use a flamethrower and burn the forest! Far Cry 3 has many great feature for a first-person shooter. You will like it.  Far Cry 3 has cool graphics, it is one of the best graphics I've ever seen, not because its so advanced, but because the weapons first-person animation is unique, so alive and... Okay maybe it's not one of the best, but I like it. Far Cry 3 has very good performance.  Too bad Far Cry 3 multiplayer feels like it has been left out, because it's not as awesome as the singleplayer mode. I was thinking the multiplayer will be more like huge maps on the same island, hundreds of players fighting together, something like that. Same thing about the cooperative play. But at least you get to blow something up with bow in singleplayer.  Far Cry 3 is not bad, its good, I recommend this.  Rating 8/10",1,1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"So....   Like everyone, with at least two braincells to rub together, and who have lived long enough to see the Ninentdo 64 be an upcoming console, it will suffice to say that this game plays good and the factions are diverse and work different enough to be fun and good to play. It is a step in the right direction compared to the cancer of Rome 2 and the repulsive filth that Attila was.  I will not really provide critique against the game itself, i don't have any real complaints about the basegame itself.  We all know what most complaints contain when it's about the shady ♥♥♥♥♥ at CA and Sega... They are like the evil twins.   The mallpractice and filthy exploitation of capitalism is repugnant and disgusting. On a sidenote it is also infuriating. I get that not every race can be implemented in the basegame as it takes so much effort and you have a family to feed.  If we lived in Animal Farm by George Orwell Sega and CA would be the filthy pigs calling the shots whilst pretending to act on our best intrests,, which is a big fat lie.   At any rate we all know the drill... You done goofed again CA, ya done goofed again. You make a good game and then your greedy black hand of death sweeps all over your garden and kills it all off.   Here's why:  1. Total War: Warhammer:  Good, not superb but good. One step forward but still 2 steps back from Rome 2 and Attilla. I probably will never forgive you for that trash.  Also the game seems to focus more on the battles which is not too bad but since they have gone through the effort of taxes, diplomacy and riots. a bit more depth would have been appreciated. They did in pre Rome 2 games.  The city building, diplomacy, everything that has nothing to do with fighting has been stupefied and made way too simple. You grow tired of it quickly and getting progress no longer feels like something to be satisfied about.  The game is made more casual ofcourse to appeal to a wider audience to rake in more cash as every other single game dev does. So the complaints are minor. I have already taken peace with the lowering of standards and the applauding and encouraging of weakness and impatience.  2. Blood for the blood god or rather the best title the community has given:  Finger for the Finger God ....................../´¯/)  ....................,/¯../  .................../..../  ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸  ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\  ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')  .........\.................'...../  ..........''...\.......... _.·´  ............\..............(  ..............\.............\  Shouldn't have to pay for something that should be a checkbox in the options menu.  TO INFERNAL HELL WITH THIS DISGUSTING PUSS RIDDEN CHEAPSHOT DLC. IT IS ♥♥♥♥ING MALLPRACTICE.  And then these disgusting missed oppurtunities of abortion proclaim this: 'BUT Age restrictions would lessen sales so DIES DLC IS GEWD. FINK ABUUT DA LITTUL KIDS ANON, DLC GEWD... '  Any parent that actually knows what their kids get into will turn off that option or not let them play that game. And CA can just make it a hidden option that you could reveal via a sideway. No toddler will ever come up with unless it reads the forums but we all know they don't hence they can't read more than: THIS GAME IS BAD.. so they can thumb down reviews.   3. Warriors of Chaos:  ♥♥♥♥ me right? Ye olde world is all about the end times and the coming of chaos, but NO make a cash barrier. ' These fat gaming junkies WILL pay to play the big antagonist of the game.' Totally no evil greedy intent in that DLC, not all. Think about the Age restriction, big muscled half naked men in beast furs, that would get the sales down because the kids couldn't play it and some corporate uptight ♥♥♥♥ would say the game is not meant for small angsty teens.  ♥♥♥♥ ME RIGHT? Pay to play Chaos warriors in ♥♥♥♥ing Warhammer.. ♥♥♥♥ me sideways.  4. Beastmen:  I do not know, i have not bought it. And here is way: I am not paying 18 units of cash on a race that probably does not contain even half of the Beastmen units... and i don't care about the campaign, not one bit.  18 euro for a race and some campaign is WAY above the expected, tollerable level. And ♥♥♥♥ your arguments of entitlement. There is a thin line between being sceptic and being a gullible ♥♥♥♥.  And also not all people feel like they should spend so much money for so little content. Some people wonder why they pay certain ammounts of cash for certain products. Yet the existence of a company like Apple, proves rarely anyone does.   And even if you disagree with the above, not everyone has one single hobby in life. Most people have multiple financial vices that force them to calculate and keep their mind on spending a budget for leisure and you want the best optimal leisure for your cash. But the only argument people come up with are the following:  You are poor. You are entitled. You are a ♥♥♥.  The latter being the best arguement. As long as people keep spamming recycled cumdumpster garbage quotes. you'll know this entertainment sector is butt♥♥♥♥ed on annihilating levels.    End of rant.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition," Pros:  -Excellent plotline -Wide variety of playstyles -Fun character customization and levelup processes -Huge open world to play in -Liam Neeson voices your father -Massive amount of content for the price -Massive replayability   Cons:  -Buggy -Compatibility issues with newer systems is common -VATS is basically required in order to use guns effectively -Some stats are decidedly more useful than others   Overall:  Fallout 3 was Bethesda's first foray into the Fallout universe, and it was also Fallout's first three dimensional game. The graphics are about on par with Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, and the open world has the same feel to it. The game is amazing and fun and a huge time sink if you take the time to explore everything. NPCs range from deeply well developed, to entertaining, to annoying, and everything in between. Leveling up oftentimes can open up entire new ways of playing the game, and exploration is always rewarded. Bethesda is known for their open world games, and they did a great job here as well. It's worth the buy if you like... well, anything Bethesda has done in the past decade. It's likely you won't encountered everything in one playthrough, and any serious encounter will have multiple solutions, making the replay value of this game through the roof.  The DLC is all included in the GOTY edition, but the vanilla brand Fallout 3 is available on Steam as well if you want to save a few bucks. You'll have to pay to buy the DLC for that version however, which makes this version more cost efficient.  The game crashes frequently, and has compatibility issues with newer systems, particularly Windows 8 and up. But if you can't get it to play consistently, you can always refund it within the first 2 hours of gameplay, so there's no harm in buying just to see if you can play it on your computer. Additionally, because this is Bethesda's first attempt, they hadn't quite figured out gunfights. Hip-shooting is comically inaccurate, and VATS is required in order to have any real shot at hitting things beyond melee range. This is resolved in New Vegas and Fallout 4, but in Fallout 3, Perception and Agility are both must-haves if you plan on using ranged weapons of any variety.  Still, these are very minor issues. The game is easy to become immersed in, and I often found myself in game for several hours longer than I intended just finishing that 'one last thing' before quitting. I played the whole game once before getting it on steam in a sale, and replaying it years later, it's as good as I remember it being. Pick it up if you're itching for more Fallout and haven't experienced this one yet.   Bottom Line:  Definitely worth the money",1,0,1

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"After reading other players' glowing reviews I thought Fallout 3 GOTY would be worth a try so I bought it during Steam's Summer Sale. I had held off purchase for years and thought perhaps by now (2014) Bethesda finally addressed some of its many, infamous bugs. But apparently NOT! How Bethesda garnered so many accolades and awards for such a buggy product I will NEVER fathom.  I tried the many fixes and suggestions to get the game stable enough to play i.e. actually got as far as Megaton initial quests e.g. Those! but the game STILL randomly and often freezes up, especially when entering indoor spaces. Only using the CTL-ALT-DELETE to Task Manager i.e. 'Fallout 3 - Not Responding' error msg and Ending it gets me back to desktop.  I don't think it's my rig as I can play BioShock Infiniite, Borderlands 2, Skyrim Legendary edition and with mods, etc without so much as a hiccup.  And I think I've tried nearly ALL the fixes available e.g. multi-core - ini file fix; K-lilte codec, disabling GFWL, etc. I followed Ben W.'s guide including installing the Ultimate Fix mod plus others, but nothing helps. At this point I'm stumped. So sadly, for me this is just another Steam version game that is essentially unplayable.  However, there are many other players that have gotten Fallout 3 GOTY to work (even on WIN 7 OS) that highly recommend it , so purchasing it IS a gamble - you have to decide whether or not it's worth the risk - esp. as it's not optimized for WIN 7.  For that reason I strongly suggest for those willing to risk it, to wait until Fallout 3 GOTY is on FIRE SALE to minimize loss of funds, just in case - like me - you can't get the game to actually play.  P.S. Will update this review if I ever do get the game to run.",-1,0,0

The artstyle is very good, the animations are very good, and the flying creatures, and magic, add a new flavour to the standard combat of Total War games.  The only disappointment, at the beginning, was the limited number of playable races, but I hope they will be implemented in future DLCs.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"TL:DR this game is the perfect combination of Total War and Warhammer. I'd highly recommend this game to fans of both. I cant wait till the whole series is out.  This game is the perfect crossover that I had always dreamed of seeing and whats even better is that CA have done a great job of turning this into a really enjoyable game. Its the first non-historical Total War game and it feels like a breath of fresh air for the series. There arent as many playable factions but the factions that are here are more diverse and play quite a bit differently to each other, compared to factions in the historical titles which were largely similar but with a few different unts.  You have the human Empire faction,which is probably the most similar to the traditional TW factions in other games with a good mix of infantry,cavalry and ranged. The Dwarfs lack cavalry but have excellent ranged and strong infantry with the book of grudges being their unique feature where you have to settle grudges with other factions or suffer a penalty. The Vampire Counts lack ranged nits but can raise undead units for quick reinforcements as well as spreading Vampiric corruption on the campaign map to decrease public order in enemy provinces. And finally the Orcs who also have a decent mix of unit types bt can suffer attrition from infighting if you dont keep fighting and raiding.   The game also has hero characters and lords which can be levelled up with new abilities and equipped with weapons and armour with unique lord characters having their own quest battle story chains. Magic also makes its TW debut and is handled quite well with spell cooldowns and miscasts if you over use a spell.  Good points: - The factions feel unique enough from each other to be interesting and to offer different challenges and playstyles. There are some really fun units like flying monsters and giants for example that add more tactical options than previous TW games. - The campaign is pretty good with the Chaos incursions in the latter part of the campaign offering a challenge that can make the late campaign a lot more interesting. The quest battles are also good and give the players some useful rewards for completing them. -This game is optimized a lot better than Attila was and I love the unit and map design that really brings the Warhammer universe to life. - The heroes and lords are handled well with heroes being useful both as agents on the campaign map as well as being embedded in your armies for use in battles. The leveling system is also great and makes you really feel invested in your generals.  Bad points: - sieges still feel a bit underwhelming though they still play better than in previous TW games. - the AI has a tendency to spam agents against you and this gets pretty annoying  ",1,0,1

Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.  5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.  For a Rocky Road Bar: 1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.",1,0,1

570,Dota 2,"Warning, this review is a short review of everything wrong with Dota 2 and the weird developers that range on 'control-obsessed freaks of nature' and a huge review of every bad thing with Steam and Valve. That was a lie, if I covered all the bad things about Valve, I'd need at least half a gigabyte of space.  This game is a perfect testament to everything wrong with Valve. We all heard the horror stories, we know how bad it is, not just as a MOBA/Dota Game/ARTS/whatever the hell, but as a game in general. I'll save you all the trouble and remind you all of THIS creepy ♥♥♥♥.   https://archive.is/gPtMH  Alternative link if you like to give click revenue to awful sites made by nerdy ♥♥♥♥♥leeves:  http://geekparty.com/how-valve-tricked-dota-2-players-into-better-behavior/   Get that burned into your retinas and read it every time you want to play this awful game. That's all you need to know about Dota. The rest of this review will be dedicated to everything wrong with Steam and Valve itself.  Today, I was trying to play Killer is Dead. Amazing game, but I installed it to my external hard drive due to low space caused by this game and Payday 2(which also sucks). Today, after realizing I need to put it on a drive that doesn't pretend to disconnect every two minutes to ♥♥♥♥ me off, I moved the KillerIsDead folder to my main drive. Everything was moved there, I double checked. It was all in there, and I followed some steps to have Steam recognize my download.  Imagine my joy when it deletes all that ♥♥♥♥ after 'recognizing local content' just to start the ♥♥♥♥ing download all over again. All 11 GB and I'm at my godfather's house, which has a whopping 30 KB/s download speed. Even when I get home it'll be 500 KB/s so if I'm lucky, I can play Killer Is Dead at 7 in the morning. All because Valve is literally incapable of making changes to the program that'll make it recognize a moved game, and you know, NOT DELETE IT.  I did a similar thing with, god help me for confessing, Origin. Yes, ORIGIN. The dumb EA client with even MORE DRM. I did the exact same thing and it didn't delete the game to redownload it. ♥♥♥♥ING ORIGIN IS A BETTER PROGRAM THAN ANYTHING VALVE HAS EVER MADE, AND CAN POSSIBLY DREAM OF MAKING AT THIS RATE. HOLY ♥♥♥♥ VALVE, THE ONLY REASON I STILL USE THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PROGRAM IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE GAMES I BOUGHT(well, rented, because if they ban me for this review, I'll have lost at LEAST $500 because how dare I hurt Gabe Newell's feelings) AND THE FACT THAT NOT ALL MY FRIENDS ON HERE HAVE SKYPE, MUMBLE, DISCORD, TEAMSPEAK, OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S FRIENDS THAT ARE KEEPING AT LEAST 20% OF YOUR USERBASE HERE.  Yes, the entire userbase. Not counting spambots and dead accoutns. You can deny it and call this an opinion piece, but it's true that people stick around here just because some of their friends have no other chat client or whatever. And even then, Steam sucks as a chat client due to no logs being saved. Valve can't even make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chat client and we STILL throw our money at them every Christmas.  'But Bear Howard,' I hear you say, 'we're buying games that aren't by Valve!' And they take a huge cut of all the profits because Gabe Newell and 'friends' are greedy ♥♥♥♥s. There's a reason that half these greenlight projects don't end well, and that's because Valve is home of greedier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s than IRS. That is one hell of an accomplishment, and I can say that as someone whose uncle worked with the IRS.  'Beeeear,' I hear you cry, 'don't be so entitled! If you don't like it, leave!' ♥♥♥♥ off and die, I spent half a grand on games in this dumb network. I refuse to throw my games out just because the developers of a client are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, you may have an anti-sour grapes attitude that lets you accept every bad thing as a blessing. Eat ♥♥♥♥, because you're why video games are on the decline. You know how people protest bad things? That's because they want it to be different and better. You drones refuse to let anything improve because you're a bunch of idiots, and I know that the fact that I'm standing to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t scares you. That's why you can shove your opinion back up your ♥♥♥, and take your toxic 'it could be worse' attitude with you, because it could be BETTER, and it can be if you shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and stop giving these hacks a way out.  Now, I'm sure anything else I say won't matter because all the children and tryhards are posting Gaben memes to 'defeat' me, and pretend they don't deserve to be molested and beaten. Therefore, I will end this smackdown of Valve with this: Step your ♥♥♥♥ up, Valve. You saw what happened to Overkill Studios with the Payday 2 fiasco. You executives always slip up in the end and even the most spergy apologist says 'well ♥♥♥♥ you guys too.' Do you have enough money to last a while, even without us? Sure, I admit it. However, if it weren't for the steady flow, your careless spending(I've seen the Twitter posts, don't act all thrifty and holier than thou) would get you in a dumpster for shelter.  And frankly, I feel bad for that dumpster.",-1,0,0

570,Dota 2,"I love mobas. As far as PC games go, it's my favorite genre. I've played the original Dota for years. League of Legends and I've dabbled in Smite and HoN. Dota 2 beats all of them as far game play, balance, hero design. It has holiday events, free skin drops. They allow you the option to sell your skins and other drops in the community market. My steam wallet is sitting at over $40 as we speak strictly from Dota 2 community market sales.  There is one critical flaw in this game. I can honestly say, that in my personal experience over 95% of the players can not, or will not speak english. Not in text, not on the mic. This makes team strat damn near impossible for an english speaker. The game allows you to check which servers and language you want to be included in - any that you leave unchecked will not add you to the matchmaking system in those locations/languages. I live in the US, and I can only speak english. So I only have US servers and english checked. Yet still every game I feel like a foreigner in my countries own servers.  I ask them why they click US/English if they can't speak the language, but it's a redundant question since they have no clue what I'm saying.  There really is no excuse for it and sadly enough it ruins the whole experience for me. I might as well be playing with bots.  In conclusion I will say that this is a great game. But unless you speak every other language except english, you're going to want to go play something else.",-1,0,0

On top of this, about 1/2 the playable races are the same thing, the Empire, or just human race. The only different races are Chaos Warriors who i personally love, yet hate that they cannot own cities, everyone hates them, and they cannot trade (mostly the same as every other race that isn't under The Empire banner'.",-1,0,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I see a bunch of negative reviews from long-time, hardcore players who have fallen out of love with this game. But you're not an experienced player if you're reading this trying to decide whether or not to give it a try, are you?  So: as a player new to this game, let me share my experience.  I love it. There is some learning curve to the combat (the controls could be a bit more intuitive), but once you get the hang of them it's SO rewarding. It feels visceral and fun. You feel like a total badass in combat. Looks and feels fantastic. Solid. Definitely the best medieval combat I've ever played.  Yes, there is team damage, it happens. War is Hell and messy. If you can deal with that, you'll have fun.   How to maximize your fun: 1) Don't take it too seriously.  2) Do the tutorial. It's a bit buggy but genuinely useful. 3) Play on the low-ranked player servers to begin with.  4) Start a private server and practice your skills against bots between matches.  5) Learn the different weapons and get a feel for their timing and ranges.  6) Almost-empty servers are a good place to have fun without so many enemies and learn from more experienced players. 7) Learn how to use stab and hack and the alternate attacks. Bind them to their own keys.  Maybe it won't be a game you play for years or get seriously competitive about. But so what? For the money, you absolutely get more than a fair share of entertainment value! Absolutely recommended!",1,0,1

Armies have a small selection of units. The required general for an army systen is still in the game and sucking even worse than before; this would not be so bad if the battles actually lasted more than 5 minits. 20v20 battles all the time and they end in 5 minits, very boring and anticlimatic.
